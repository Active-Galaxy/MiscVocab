Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS) is a commonly used measure of belief in the paranormal. The scale contains items that index extrasensory perception (ESP), psychokinesis (PK), and life after death (LAD). Although, research employs the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale as both a general (unidimensional) and factorial (multidimensional) measure, few studies have examined the appropriateness of these solutions. Accordingly, the present paper tested the psychometric integrity of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale via two studies. Study 1 assessed Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factorial structure using confirmatory factor analysis. To achieve this, merging of Australian Sheep-Goat 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p0
studies. Study 1 assessed Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factorial structure using confirmatory factor analysis. To achieve this, merging of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale data from previously published studies and ongoing work created a heterogeneous sample of 1,601 responses. Analysis revealed that a two-factor bifactor model best explained Australian Sheep-Goat Scale organization. This comprised a general overarching factor incorporating two subfactors (ESP and PK). Factor loadings and omega reliability supported a unidimensional structure for the most part. Removal of life after death items improved model fit because the factor added unnecessary complexity and undermined scale psychometric integrity. Study 2, using a supplementary composite sample 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p0.2
model fit because the factor added unnecessary complexity and undermined scale psychometric integrity. Study 2, using a supplementary composite sample of 320 respondents, assessed the convergent validity of the emergent Australian Sheep-Goat Scale model against a recently published Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) bifactor solution. Comparison revealed high convergent validity. The general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor, despite deriving from only psi-related dimensions (ESP and PK) predicted Revised Paranormal Belief Scale scores. This finding indicated that Australian Sheep-Goat Scale brevity relative to the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is advantageous when assessing general belief in the paranormal. The ASGS, notwithstanding limited construct content, 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p0.43
the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is advantageous when assessing general belief in the paranormal. The ASGS, notwithstanding limited construct content, functions as an effective measure of paranormal belief. Additionally, Study 2 replicated the bifactor structure identified in Study 1 and invariance testing supported invariance of form, factor loadings and item intercepts for this solution across Studies 1 and 2.

denotes believers (sheep) and disbelievers (goats) in the paranormal . The nomenclature originated from Gertrude Schmeidler who observed that increased performance within ESP experiments was associated with the belief that ESP was possible within that particular setting. ESP in this context referred to “the non-inferential acquisition of information relating to stimuli which is inexplicable in terms of ‘orthodox’ sensory communication” . Since Schmeidler’s exact use of the sheep-goat designation, the term has broadened to include belief in the possibility of ESP, experiencing ESP and acceptance of psychic phenomena generally [psychokinesis (PK) and life after death (LAD)]. More generally, researchers employ the 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p0.88
experiencing ESP and acceptance of psychic phenomena generally [psychokinesis (PK) and life after death (LAD)]. More generally, researchers employ the label ubiquitously to signify the presence or absence of belief in the paranormal . Thalbourne and Delin noted this generalization arose from a widening of the notion of the paranormal to include a broad spectrum of supernatural phenomena. Originally, the descriptor ‘paranormal’ served merely as a synonym for psychic. Generic usage of the sheep-goat distinction, in part, evolved from a lack of conceptual agreement about the nature and structure of the paranormal. Hence, although measurement instruments adhere to common guidelines, such 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.05
of conceptual agreement about the nature and structure of the paranormal. Hence, although measurement instruments adhere to common guidelines, such as Broad’s Basic Limiting Principles causation, no action at a distance, or perception of physical events/objects unmediated by sensations) , content across scales varies significantly. For example, the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) characterizes the paranormal as a multidimensional construct comprising several item clusters (traditional religious belief, psi, witchcraft, superstition, spiritualism, extraordinary life forms and precognition). Contemporary psychometric assessment of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale recommends a bifactor structure comprising a single overarching construct, encompassing several related, but conceptually independent subfactors 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.15

The presence of topics outside of core parapsychology within measurement instruments reflects the stretching and blurring of paranormal boundaries Illustratively, the Paranormal Short Inventory contains questions about unidentified flying objects. Furthermore, scales frequently include items indexing belief in fringe subject matter, such as new age treatments acupuncture) and lost continents . Although, these topics share thematic features with the paranormal, notably unusualness and lack of a genuine evidential basis, they are not strictly supernatural because they challenge rather than necessitate 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.25
notably unusualness and lack of a genuine evidential basis, they are not strictly supernatural because they challenge rather than necessitate change within current scientific thinking. Acknowledging these conceptual issues, Thalbourne and Delin recommended restriction of the sheep-goat distinction to core parapsychological phenomena. This focus informed the content and development of sheep-goat measures. Over the years, various scales have assessed the sheep-goat variable. These have differed in terms of factors and item numbers (i.e., single vs. multiple items) . Notable examples are the Icelandic and Australian Sheep-Goat scales. The Icelandic version contains questions about belief in general extrasensory perception (ESP) [“do you 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.35
the Icelandic and Australian Sheep-Goat scales. The Icelandic version contains questions about belief in general extrasensory perception (ESP) [“do you believe that the existence of telepathy (thought-transference) or clairvoyance”], precognition (“do you believe that the ability to know the future or to have dreams about it is”) and frequency of reading about psychic phenomena (“do you read books or articles on psychic phenomena”). Higher scores indicate stronger belief in ESP. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS) began as a list of questions assessing endorsement of ESP (belief in/experience) and life after death (the possibility of contact with the deceased) within participants taking 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.45
assessing endorsement of ESP (belief in/experience) and life after death (the possibility of contact with the deceased) within participants taking part in an ESP experiment . Subsequent item analysis produced a 10-item measure, which provided support for the sheep-goat dichotomy via correlation with experimental performance . Further ESP-related work supported the scale’s predictive power Although, some studies observed no significant relationship between belief and performance As researchers became increasingly aware of potential psychological differences between believers and non-believers the need for general measures of paranormal belief increased. For instance, researchers observed effects for locus of control , social interest , death 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.55
general measures of paranormal belief increased. For instance, researchers observed effects for locus of control , social interest , death threat and death concerns , dream interpretation , personality and critical thinking . Accordingly, the Paranormal Belief Scale and the 10-item Australian Sheep-Goat Scale emerged as prevalently used measures. In 1983, the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale added additional ESP items assessing belief in the possibility of precognition, sender-initiated and receptive telepathy . Beyond increasing construct breadth, the 13-item version demonstrated no additional psychometric benefits; the scale correlated highly with the extant 10-item version . The modified Australian Sheep-Goat Scale featured in several 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.65
psychometric benefits; the scale correlated highly with the extant 10-item version . The modified Australian Sheep-Goat Scale featured in several published studies In 1985, the scale appended five further items indexing belief and experience of PK. Comparisons across Australian Sheep-Goat Scale versions revealed high correlations. Psychometric evaluation of the 18-item Australian Sheep-Goat Scale specified the measure was a satisfactory measure of belief in and experience of core psychic phenomena. The scale demonstrated good reliability (internal and test–retest) and concurrent validity Exploratory factor analysis, using principal components analysis, confirmed that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale contained three factors ESP, psychokinesis and Afterlife .

factor analysis, using principal components analysis, confirmed that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale contained three factors ESP, psychokinesis and Afterlife . This built on previous analysis, which supported the notion that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale was multidimensional Along with variations in content, Australian Sheep-Goat Scale response formats have differed analog) . The forced-choice format presents items as statements (e.g., “I believe in ESP”) alongside three alternative responses, “false” (zero), “uncertain” (one), and “true” (two). Summative scores range from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating increased levels of paranormal belief The six-point Likert scale replaces fixed choices with options between “strongly 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.85
with higher scores indicating increased levels of paranormal belief The six-point Likert scale replaces fixed choices with options between “strongly disagree” and “strongly agree” Roe advocated use of the Likert scale format because he was critical of the visual analog response style. The visual analog format, asks respondents to record level of item agreement on a horizontal line anchored by goat and sheep belief. The horizontal line is 44 units long (one unit = one-eighth if an inch). Scores on each item are obtained using a rule and range from 1 to 44; recoded as 1–10 = 0, 11–30 = 1, 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p1.95
item are obtained using a rule and range from 1 to 44; recoded as 1–10 = 0, 11–30 = 1, and 31–44 = 2. Dividing totals by 22 produced values from 0.05 to 2. Totaling across items and rounding generates scores between 1 and 36. This scoring system approximates the false, uncertain and true format . A subsequent Australian Sheep-Goat Scale adaptation by Lange and Thalbourne purified the scale. This involved Rasch scaling, which identified New Age-related and Traditional Belief items (LAD). Removal of the life after death items to correct for bias reduced the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale to 16-items. The 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p2.04
(LAD). Removal of the life after death items to correct for bias reduced the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale to 16-items. The advantage of Rasch scaling is that it produces interval-level scores, which are independent of gender and age bias. Despite these psychometric developments, the majority of studies continue to use the original 18-item measure and fail to apply Rasch scaling. Failure to apply Rasch scaling is problematic because the two Australian Sheep-Goat Scale items that form the life after death factor are not productive to measurement and may compromise the validity of the scale . At a factorial level, Rasch scaling indicates 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p2.13
not productive to measurement and may compromise the validity of the scale . At a factorial level, Rasch scaling indicates that the life after death subscale does not function as a reliable measurement tool. Indeed, removal of the life after death factor produces a single factor New Age Belief solution This issue potentially compromises analysis at the factorial level, especially in studies, which focus on subscale differences . However, at a global level, this is less of a concern because slight age and gender biases have less impact on the overall measurement of paranormal belief. Hence, original 18-item scale remains an 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p2.21
age and gender biases have less impact on the overall measurement of paranormal belief. Hence, original 18-item scale remains an internally reliable measure of belief in the paranormal. The 18-item Australian Sheep-Goat Scale across response formats has typically demonstrated internal reliability in the good to excellent range . Illustratively, Thalbourne and Delin reported a Cronbach alpha (a) of 0.94 for the visual analog scale and Dagnall et al. an alpha of 0.92 for the forced-choice version. Foreign translations have demonstrated similar levels of internal reliability. For example, Swedish and Portuguese . The Rasch version of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale also possesses 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p2.3
levels of internal reliability. For example, Swedish and Portuguese . The Rasch version of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale also possesses good (a = 0.82, Dagnall et al., to excellent internal reliability. Assessing the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale alongside equivalent measures of belief in the paranormal the Manchester Metropolitan University New, Dagnall et al., reveals that the scale in terms of internal reliability performs at a commensurate level . In summary, Australian Sheep-Goat Scale appraisal was required in order to provide conceptual clarity.

Specifically, appreciation of the factorial structure of provides guidelines for the subsequent implementation and analysis of data collected via the ASGS. Accordingly, the present paper examined whether the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale functioned best as a multidimensional or general measure. Relative to the RPBS, few studies use Australian Sheep-Goat Scale subscales to assess variations in belief. However, this has occurred and informed the formation of nuanced conclusions about the functional properties of inferred dimensions and LAD) . This paper tested the veracity of this approach by including multidimensionality vs. unidimensionality within a single analysis.

of this approach by including multidimensionality vs. unidimensionality within a single analysis. Explicitly, bifactor modeling assessed Australian Sheep-Goat Scale dimensionality and factorial solution adequacy. This analysis was vital to defining the boundaries of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale use. In this context, previous work has failed to delineate adequately the dimensionality of the ASGS. Noting the established use of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale within the parapsychological and psychological literature and the fact that researchers report both unidimensional and factorial scores, this paper undertook two studies examining the measure’s psychometric integrity. Study 1 tested Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factorial structure, and Study 2, evaluated measurement 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p2.56
two studies examining the measure’s psychometric integrity. Study 1 tested Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factorial structure, and Study 2, evaluated measurement invariance of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and its performance in relation to the RPBS. STUDY 1: FACTORIAL STRUCTURE OF THE AUSTRALIAN SHEEP-GOAT SCALE Within published work researchers have used the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale as both a unidimensional and multidimensional measure (ESP, PK, and LAD) Although it is rare to use Australian Sheep-Goat Scale subscales, there are clear advantages to the inclusion of factorial comparisons. Specifically, although ESP and psychokinesis collectively represent forms of psi, the degree to which people endorse the 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p2.65
of factorial comparisons. Specifically, although ESP and psychokinesis collectively represent forms of psi, the degree to which people endorse the phenomena varies. Generally, as evidenced by reported instances ESP appears more plausible and probable than psychokinesis . In this context, it is important to assess the effectiveness of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale at both a general and factorial level. Recent related work examined the factorial structure of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale . After consideration of a range of theoretically and empirically driven models, Drinkwater et al. identified the best fitting data model. This was a bifactor model comprising a single 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p2.73
empirically driven models, Drinkwater et al. identified the best fitting data model. This was a bifactor model comprising a single overarching construct, derived from related, but conceptually distinct subfactors. This approach usefully delimited the most appropriate scoring system for the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and reaffirmed the veracity of research using general and seven-factor solutions. Accordingly, Study 1 examined whether it was valid for researchers to use both unidimensional and factorial Australian Sheep-Goat Scale solutions. As with the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale paper, the intention was to delineate appropriate scale scoring.

Method Respondents Merging of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale data sets from published studies and continuing work produced a large heterogeneous sample . Several researchers have previously employed this approach to assess scale structure and integrity. Notably, evaluation of Revised Paranormal Belief Scale structure , top-down purification of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale , and Need for Closure Scale validation . Merging of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale data sets was appropriate because the researchers had previously used the measure in comparable studies addressing different research questions.

Combining these data made it possible to examine the psychometric structure of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale using sophisticated statistical techniques. Large data sets facilitate the performance of complex analytical methods by virtue of enhanced statistical power and greater within sample variation . For these reasons, Brown advocates that confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) should use as many cases as possible. In this context, amalgamation of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale data sets was an expedient method that utilized existing screened data to meet these parameters.

More generally, integration of small data sets avoids research costs associated with study design, recruitment and data collection, and produces a sample that would typical prove difficult to recruit because of time and cost constraints. The mean (M) sample age was 27.01 years Disaggregation by gender revealed that 547 respondents were male and 1054 female . Data collection occurred between September 2012 and September 2016 (see “Ethics” section).

Recruitment was by emails to students (undergraduate and postgraduate) enrolled on healthcare programs Physiotherapy, Psychology, Speech and Language Therapy, etc.), staff across faculties at a United Kingdom university, and local businesses/community groups. There were two exclusion criteria. Firstly, respondents had to be at least 18 years of age. Secondly, in order to prevent multiple responses instructions stated that respondents must not participate if they had undertaken similar research.

Procedure Respondents completed the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale in conjunction with measures assessing cognitive-perceptual personality factors, decision-making and anomalous beliefs. All studies used the same basic standardized procedures. Prior to participation, the researchers presented prospective respondents with comprehensive background information. This contained the purpose of the study and outlined ethical procedures. Respondents agreeing to participate recorded informed consent by selecting an option confirming their willingness to take part. They then received the study materials, which 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p3.38
recorded informed consent by selecting an option confirming their willingness to take part. They then received the study materials, which comprised the relevant measures and scales. Respondents also provided basic demographic information (age, preferred gender, course of study if student, etc.). Procedural instructions directed respondents to work through the sections systematically at their own pace, to answer all questions in an open and honest manner, and reassured respondents that there were no right or wrong answers. Section order rotated across respondents to prevent potential order effects.

Data Analysis Plan Analysis evaluated a series of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale models. Firstly, a one-factor model, which acted as a baseline comparison for later solutions. Next, a correlated three-factor model based on Thalbourne and Delin examined whether ESP, PK, and life after death subfactors most effectively represented the ASGS.

Subsequently, a model based on Lange and Thalbourne tested whether a single New Age Belief factor removed) best represented the ASGS. A correlated two-factor variant of this condensed 16-item version of the scale tested goodness of fit, with the identification of subfactors consistent with those initially proposed by Thalbourne and Delin (i.e., ESP and PK, but not LAD). Lastly, a bifactor version of this solution assessed data-model fit. A range of indices determined goodness of fit. The chi-square statistic compares the 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p3.77

The chi-square statistic compares the expected and observed covariance matrix, with a non-significant difference preferable. Chi-square, however, typically over-rejects good models. Accordingly, additional absolute fit indices Approximation, RMSEA; Standardized Root-Mean-Square Residual, SRMR) assessed fit, with values of 0.05, 0.06–0.08, and 0.08–1.0 indicative of good, satisfactory, and marginal fit was included for RMSEA.

Lastly, alpha and omega coefficients determined the reliability of the ASGS. Coefficient omega (&) and omega hierarchical (&h) provide more effective estimates of reliability of bifactor models Coefficient omega considers specific and general factor variance in its reliability estimation, whereas hierarchical omega computes the reliability of a latent factor minus the variance from other general and specific factors.

The Bollen-Stine bootstrap p examined fit in addition to absolute and relative fit indices.

An inspection of intercorrelations revealed that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale total score and the subfactors of ESP, PK, and life after death possessed significant positive relationships. A large correlation of 0.96 existed between Australian Sheep-Goat Scale total and ESP, which is reflective of the fact that ESP comprises a large number of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale items . The lowest intercorrelation existed between psychokinesis and LAD, r = 0.29, p < 0.001. Confirmatory Factor Analysis The one-factor model 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p4.25
The lowest intercorrelation existed between psychokinesis and LAD, r = 0.29, p < 0.001. Confirmatory Factor Analysis The one-factor model reported a poor fit, $2 (135, = 4539.67, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.66, IFI = 0.66, RMSEA = 0.14 , SRMR = 0.10.

Bollen-Stine, p = 0.002, indicated poor fit. A three-factor bifactor model reported marginal fit, $2 = 1746.75, p 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p4.35

Bollen-Stine, p = 0.002, indicated poor fit. A lower AIC for the three-factor bifactor solution existed in comparison with one-factor and correlated three-factor variants, suggesting the bifactor was most suitable for the data. The one-factor model based on Lange and Thalbourne fitted poorly overall, $2 = 3861.74, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.68, IFI = 0.68, RMSEA = 0.15 (90% SRMR = 0.10. Bollen-Stine, p = 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p4.44

A correlated two-factor version of Lange and Thalbourne reported unsatisfactory fit on all indices, $2 = 2102.99, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.83, IFI = 0.83, RMSEA = 0.11 but SRMR = 0.08. Bollen-Stine, p = 0.002, supported unsatisfactory fit. A twofactor bifactor solution indicated good fit on all indices, $2 = 1196.78, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.91, IFI = 0.91, SRMR = 0.06, but RMSEA = 0.09 (90% CI of suggested marginal fit.

However, given marginal to good fit existed on absolute and relative indices, it is possible the Bollen- Stine result is symptomatic of the large sample . Accordingly, analysis considered the Standardized Residual Covariance Matrix. The majority of residual covariances should be less than two if the model signifies good fit , this was apparent for approximately 85% of cases. Consultation of AIC across the 16-item solutions suggested that the bifactor variant fitted these data more suitably 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p4.64
85% of cases. Consultation of AIC across the 16-item solutions suggested that the bifactor variant fitted these data more suitably than the one-factor and correlated two-factor model . Compared with the three-factor bifactor model, the two-factor bifactor solution possessed marginally superior data-model fit. This therefore was the most appropriate factorial conceptualization of the ASGS. An inspection of factor loadings for the two-factor bifactor model revealed that all items loaded above the minimum cutoff of 0.32 on the general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor. In comparison, items 3, 4, 2, and 13 did not significantly load on the ESP subfactor, indicating that these 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p4.73
factor. In comparison, items 3, 4, 2, and 13 did not significantly load on the ESP subfactor, indicating that these items more directly predicted a general factor. In addition, negative loadings were evident for some ESP items, which can unexpectedly occur in bifactor models as a function of a crossover suppression effect . The average factor loadings were 0.56 on PK, 0.03 on ESP, and 0.58 on the general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor. Although loadings were satisfactory for PK, items 15, 16, 17 loaded more highly than on the general factor. Interestingly, these items index personal experience of PK, which are 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p4.83
16, 17 loaded more highly than on the general factor. Interestingly, these items index personal experience of PK, which are slightly different in tone to the rest of the measure that focuses more on belief. Overall, belief within the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale best represented a general factor, particularly in relation to ESP items. However, items related to psychokinesis also require consideration. The poor data-model fit of the one-factor 16-item solution reinforces this finding. Reliability The 16-item Australian Sheep-Goat Scale possessed high reliability (a = 0.89, 95% CI Reliability was high for both the psychokinesis (a = 0.85, and ESP (a = 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p4.93

Omega hierarchical was reasonably high for a general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor . Lower estimates existed for psychokinesis and ESP . A general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor explained 69% of the variance. psychokinesis and ESP accounted for 22.3% and 8.7%, respectively. The percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUCs) was 45.8%, signifying a reasonable number of correlations reflect general factor variance.

factor variance. Discussion Study 1 found that a two-factor bifactor model best represented Australian Sheep-Goat Scale measurement. This comprised a general overarching factor encompassing two related, but conceptually independent subfactors (ESP and PK). Omega reliability supported this conceptualization. However, an important degree of variance existed for Australian Sheep-Goat Scale subfactors, particularly PK. The poor datamodel fit of the one-factor solution reinforced the validity of the two-factor bifactor solution. Therefore, it is likely that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale reflects a unidimensional structure for the most part, but specific psychokinesis items need consideration when implementing the measure. Concurring with Lange and Thalbourne , 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p5.35
for the most part, but specific psychokinesis items need consideration when implementing the measure. Concurring with Lange and Thalbourne , analysis suggested that the New Age-related items best measured belief in the paranormal. Removal of life after death items, indexing Traditional Belief, improved model fit. These items added unnecessary complexity to the model. Omission of the life after death subscale is conceptually and psychometrically appropriate because the subscale comprises only two items. Accordingly, life after death fails to assess adequately construct breadth. Additionally, informed advocates of paranormal powers class ESP and psychokinesis as forms of psi. This notion derives from the 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p5.5
breadth. Additionally, informed advocates of paranormal powers class ESP and psychokinesis as forms of psi. This notion derives from the supposition that ESP and psychokinesis arise from inexplicable forces beyond the understanding of established physical principles. Hence, there is considerable parapsychological debate about the extent to which the two alleged phenomena share common features and/or overlap . Some theorists have gone so far as to question whether ESP and psychokinesis represent a unitary domain . Whereas, other theorists view the two phenomena as complementary, but distinct in terms of characteristics and predisposing conditions. This notion accords with layperson accounts of psi.

phenomena as complementary, but distinct in terms of characteristics and predisposing conditions. This notion accords with layperson accounts of psi. Thus, although the phenomena share considerable variance, individuals more commonly report ESP experiences and people generally consider the existence of ESP more likely than psychokinesis Contrastingly, life after death represents a distinct belief dimension. The RPBS, despite issues with factorial structure, acknowledges this distinction. Explicitly, life after death within the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale straddles two separate factors, traditional religious belief continues to exist though the body may die”) and spiritualism (i.e., “It is possible to communicate with the dead”).

belief continues to exist though the body may die”) and spiritualism (i.e., “It is possible to communicate with the dead”). These are distinct to the psi subscale, which comprises a combination of psychokinesis and ESP items, respectively. Overall, Study 1 indicated that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale functions well at a global level. The original two-factor solution (with life after death omitted) was the best fitting bifactor model. STUDY 2: INVARIANCE AND CONVERGENT VALIDITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN SHEEP-GOAT SCALE The Revised Paranormal Belief Scale due to its breadth and multidimensionality features in a range of empirical research. Indeed, the Revised Paranormal Belief 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p5.96
Belief Scale due to its breadth and multidimensionality features in a range of empirical research. Indeed, the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is the most widely used measure of paranormal belief within psychology . Conversely, parapsychologists tend to use the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale because it focuses on fundamental paranormal concepts (extra-sensory perception, psychokinesis and LAD). The preference for the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale stems from the fact that the measure evolved within parapsychology, where it subsequently developed an acknowledged reputation. The fact that psychology and parapsychology often use different measures to assess belief in the paranormal creates potential issues. Primarily, the concern that 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.07
psychology and parapsychology often use different measures to assess belief in the paranormal creates potential issues. Primarily, the concern that results may arise as an artifact of the scale used and may not extrapolate across studies. For these reasons, it is important to ensure that the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale index the same underlying construct. This is not easy to establish because few studies have used the scales concurrently. When employed together, studies report high positive correlations between the two measures Indeed, the scales share approximately 60% variance. This suggests that the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale assesses 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.16
between the two measures Indeed, the scales share approximately 60% variance. This suggests that the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale assesses the core aspects of the paranormal belief indexed by the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ESP, LAD, and PK). Convergent validity testing will examine the degree of convergence between the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and RPBS. An additional method that tests whether the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale is transferable across studies is invariance testing. This assesses whether measurement interpretation is consistently across contexts and populations (and hence differences reflect true mean variations) or if any observed differences in scores are likely due to an artifact 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.25
(and hence differences reflect true mean variations) or if any observed differences in scores are likely due to an artifact of the measure . A paucity of research has examined invariance of the ASGS. Study 2 examined measurement invariance and the convergent validity of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale bifactor model specified in Study 1. Specifically, following analysis of factor structure invariance tests examined whether the bifactor solution was invariant across each of the samples used Evaluating invariance among samples from separate studies is consistent with the approach of Schellenberg et al. , and determines whether the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale is trustworthy 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.34
studies is consistent with the approach of Schellenberg et al. , and determines whether the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale is trustworthy across different studies. Furthermore, using structural equation modeling (SEM) in a latent modeling context, Study 2 evaluated the extent to which Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores predicted the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale bifactor solution identified by Drinkwater et al. . This was important because convergence specifies the extent to which the scales measure general paranormal belief and share conceptual overlap (ESP and PK). In addition, analysis via SEM is preferable to alternative approaches, such as regression analysis, because SEM incorporates a simultaneous 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.43
PK). In addition, analysis via SEM is preferable to alternative approaches, such as regression analysis, because SEM incorporates a simultaneous assessment of latent constructs and measurement error when assessing relationships This provides a more parsimonious evaluation of the shared variance among variables. Another advantage of SEM is the assessment of the measurement models in a confirmatory manner prior to testing structural relationships. By focusing on the degree of consistency between data and proposed factor model, SEM offers a rigorous assessment of the scales. This approach ensures that prior to testing structural relationships measures are reliable and fit with the existing a 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.51
the scales. This approach ensures that prior to testing structural relationships measures are reliable and fit with the existing a priori conceptions. Method Respondents The sample comprised 320 respondents who had completed both the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and the RPBS. Respondents mean (M) age = 29.57 . Within the sample 95 were male and 225 female . Respondents were collected following the perimeters outlined in Study 1. Since the original studies looked at a range of beliefs over a period of time instructions told respondents not to participate if they had previously completed research on belief in the paranormal.

time instructions told respondents not to participate if they had previously completed research on belief in the paranormal. This direction ensured that Studies 1 and 2 contained different respondents. Measures Study 2 used the 16-item version of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale tested in Study 1 and the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale . The Revised Paranormal Belief Scale contains 26-items that assess belief in the paranormal. Respondents indicate level of agreement to statements (e.g., “There is a devil”) on a seven-point Likert scale (responses range from 1 = strongly The Revised Paranormal Belief Scale comprises seven belief dimensions: Traditional Religious Belief (TRB), 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.69
scale (responses range from 1 = strongly The Revised Paranormal Belief Scale comprises seven belief dimensions: Traditional Religious Belief (TRB), Psi Belief (PSI), Precognition (PRE), Superstition (SUP),Witchcraft (WIT), Spiritualism (SPIR), and Extraordinary Lifeforms (ELF). Previous research documents that the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale has adequate reliability and validity. Specifically, Drinkwater et al. reported a Cronbach alpha of 0.93 for the full scale. The subscales were also satisfactorily reliable (apart from ELF). Specifically, Traditional Religious Belief a = 0.88 ; witchcraft a = 0.80 ; PSI a = 0.83 (95% superstition a = 0.83 ; Spiritualism a = 0.83 ; precognition a 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.78
= 0.80 ; PSI a = 0.83 (95% superstition a = 0.83 ; Spiritualism a = 0.83 ; precognition a = 0.86 (95% ELF indexed lower reliability, as a = 0.54 . Additional existing studies report concerns with the ELF subscale , and this is a commonly accepted issue with the RPBS. Accordingly, theorists generally regard the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale as a satisfactory measure of belief in the paranormal overall . Some critics question the dimensionality of the measure. A recent paper by Drinkwater et al. recommends a bifactor solution, where the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale best represents belief in 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.87
recent paper by Drinkwater et al. recommends a bifactor solution, where the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale best represents belief in the paranormal as a general overarching construct comprising several related, but conceptually independent subfactors. Procedure and Ethics Procedure and ethics were identical in Study 1. As in previous projects, when respondents completed the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale together, scale presentation order was counterbalanced. Data Analysis Plan Prior to assessing structural relationships, CFA examined the two-factor bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale model from Study 1 and the bifactor Revised Paranormal Belief Scale model independently. Alpha and omega coefficients determined 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p6.96
Sheep-Goat Scale model from Study 1 and the bifactor Revised Paranormal Belief Scale model independently. Alpha and omega coefficients determined scale reliability. Multi-group CFA assessed invariance in relation to progressively restrictive models among the sample from Study 1 and Study 2 . Models tested invariance at the configural (invariance of form or factor structure), metric (invariance of factor loadings) and scalar (invariance of item intercepts) level. This comprises an assessment of configural, weak and strong factorial invariance . Further tests (i.e., strict invariance) are unnecessary given these are rarely satisfied .

(i.e., strict invariance) are unnecessary given these are rarely satisfied . Critical values using Chen’s criteria determined suitable fit at each stage: a CFI difference below 0.01 alongside an RMSEA difference less than 0.015. Invariance did not consider chi-square due to its sensitivity with large samples, as recommended by Brown . To examine the convergent validity of the ASGS, both specific and general factors of the bifactor model were regressed onto the RPBS. Specifically, the established seven-factor bifactor solution of Drinkwater et al. acted as the criterion. In this model, a general factor of paranormal belief explained the majority of Revised 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p7.13
et al. acted as the criterion. In this model, a general factor of paranormal belief explained the majority of Revised Paranormal Belief Scale variance; therefore, the general factor acted as the dependent variable while controlling for the variance of the seven factors. The relative strength of general vs. specific subfactors of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale in relation to the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale indicates which facets most appropriately align with an established index of paranormal belief.

As with Study 1, analyses used bootstrapping to generate The Bollen-Stine bootstrap p additionally examined fit. Significant intercorrelations existed among all variables, with the lowest correlation between Extraordinary Lifeforms and PK, r = 0.19, p = 0.001.

The highest correlation among Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale subfactors existed in relation to ESP and Spirituality, r = 0.71, p < 0.001. Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale correlated positively, r = 0.71, p < 0.001. Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Reliability Analysis via CFA reported good fit across all indices for the two-factor bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale solution, $2 = 279.78, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.91, IFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.08 (90% CI of 0.07 SRMR 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p7.38

However, the majority of standardized residual covariances were below 2.

To maintain consistency with Drinkwater et al. analysis permitted error covariance between items 1 and 15, 3, and 17, 21 and 26. Bollen-Stine, p = 0.002, inferred poor fit.

However, the majority of standardized residual covariances were below 2, suggesting that the estimated model fitted these data well. Similar to Study 1, Australian Sheep-Goat Scale items loaded reasonably well on a general factor with an average loading of 0.54. In addition, items loaded sufficiently on psychokinesis (average loading of and lower on ESP . Consistent with Study 1, items 15, 16, 17 loaded highly on psychokinesis and to a greater degree than the general factor. Negative loadings were again apparent for ESP.

This subfactor was more complex to interpret in the presence of a general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor. It is important to note that these negative loadings occurred in the context of positive, significant loadings on a general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor. Relatedly, all Revised Paranormal Belief Scale items loaded relatively highly on a general factor (all apart from item 20 .

Multi-Group Analysis Invariance testing used bootstrapping and the Bollen-Stine p-value due to the presence of data non-normality across Studies 1 and 2. Mardia’s coefficient supported this decision . Assessment of configural invariance for the bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale model across Study 1 and Study 2 suggested satisfactory data-model fit, $2 (172, = 1724.92, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.89, IFI = 0.89, RMSEA = 0.06 , SRMR = 0.06.

Assessment of scalar invariance supported strong factorial invariance Bollen-Stine p = 0.002, yet 85% of standardized residual covariances were lower than 2. Model Test A full structural test of the linear relationship between the bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale model and the bifactor Revised Paranormal Belief Scale model reported satisfactory data-model fit, $2 = 1799.54, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.89, IFI = 0.89, RMSEA = 0.06 (90% CI of 0.06 SRMR = 0.06.

An examination of structural paths revealed that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale general factor (ASGS) significantly predicted the general Revised Paranormal Belief Scale factor while accounting for the variance of the seven Revised Paranormal Belief Scale subfactors, b = 0.81, p = 0.002 . ESP and PK, however, did not significantly predict RPBS, b = 􀀀0.28, p = 0.19 and b = 0.01, p = 0.84 (95% CI respectively. 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p8.17

The next model in order to examine the effect of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale subfactors on RPBS, constrained the path from Australian Sheep-Goat Scale to Revised Paranormal Belief Scale to zero. The constrained solution reported marginal fit on all indices $2 = 1799.54, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.88, IFI = 0.88, RMSEA = 0.06 but SRMR = 0.10, indicated unacceptable fit. Inspection of the structural paths indicated that ESP and psychokinesis significantly 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p8.29

Inspection of the structural paths indicated that ESP and psychokinesis significantly predicted Revised Paranormal Belief Scale in the absence of ASGS, b = 0.87, p < 0.001 (95% CI of 0.80 and b = 0.23, p = 0.002 , respectively. AIC values (in addition to the fit indices mentioned above) specified that the full model possessed a superior data-model fit compared with the constrained model . In addition, Bollen-Stine p = 0.002.

Compared with the full model, a considerably greater number of residual covariances were higher than 2, inferring that the full model estimated these data more appropriately. Results supported the superiority of a general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor in predicting a related criterion (RPBS). Due to successful replication with a separate sample, findings established convergent validity of the bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale structure. Particularly, they provide evidence of a strong relationship with a comparable measure of paranormal belief. Discussion Study 2, revealed high convergent validity between the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale bifactor solutions.

high convergent validity between the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale bifactor solutions. The general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor despite deriving only from psi related dimensions (ESP and PK) predicted Revised Paranormal Belief Scale scores. This suggested that the brevity of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale in relation to the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is a distinct advantage when assessing general paranormal belief. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale despite limited construct content appears to function as an effective measure of paranormal belief.

As documented in previous research , the patterns of predictive relations in a bifactor analysis can be the opposite of zero-order correlations. ESP and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale possessed an initial r = 0.71. This discrepancy is likely a function of the general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor assuming variance in the analysis given the relationship between ESP and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale emerged as positive after controlling for ASGS. Additionally, Study 2 replicated the factorial structure identified in Study 1 with a 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p8.77
emerged as positive after controlling for ASGS. Additionally, Study 2 replicated the factorial structure identified in Study 1 with a discrete sample of respondents. Particularly, a general Australian Sheep-Goat Scale factor accounted for the majority of scale variance and possessed a similar magnitude of average factor loading. psychokinesis demonstrated reasonably high factor loadings, and ESP recorded a low average factor loading, suggesting that the majority of items likely predict general ASGS. Omega hierarchical estimates supported these results. Measurement invariance tests comparing Study 1 with Study 2 respondents supported configural, weak and strong invariance for the bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale solution. Findings 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p8.89
Study 1 with Study 2 respondents supported configural, weak and strong invariance for the bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale solution. Findings confirmed that the bifactor Australian Sheep-Goat Scale model was robust and, to an extent, generalizable. Study 2 also successfully replicated the seven-factor bifactor Revised Paranormal Belief Scale solution of Drinkwater et al. . OVERALL DISCUSSION Assessment of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale structure revealed that a two-factor bifactor model, comprising a general paranormal belief dimension encompassing two discrete but related facets (ESP and PK), demonstrated superior fit. Factor loadings were higher for a general factor and hierarchical omega indicated that a general factor 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p9.01

These results support the notion that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale measures general level of paranormal belief and is, for the most part, unidimensional . In practice, findings recommend the use of total scale scores as opposed to independent subscales. An amount of non-redundant variance existed, however, particularly for PK. In addition, ESP and psychokinesis subscales were conceptually compatible with their factor labels and demonstrated reliability. These subscales can be utilized when administering the measure, but 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p9.22
were conceptually compatible with their factor labels and demonstrated reliability. These subscales can be utilized when administering the measure, but in the presence of general scale scores. This conclusion is consistent with other published work relating to bifactor models . Invariance testing supported invariance of form, factor loadings and item intercepts across both Studies 1 and 2. These results are encouraging because they suggest that differences in Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores are likely to reflect true mean variations rather than measurement bias, thus supporting future use of the measure across different subpopulations/samples. From a belief measurement perspective, the emergent model was 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p9.43
bias, thus supporting future use of the measure across different subpopulations/samples. From a belief measurement perspective, the emergent model was congruent with the view that ESP and psychokinesis denote associated forms of phenomena. Indeed, based on global taxonomic features, parapsychology classifies both as forms of psi. Conceptual overlap arises from the fact that ESP and psychokinesis arise from alleged psychic/mental powers, whose existence contravenes established scientific principles. These characteristics apply also to other phenomena. Hence, the term psi embraces further paranormal occurrences, such as precognition and remote viewing . Consideration of individual psi facets reveals that they vary greatly in terms 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p9.64

This is important in the context of the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale because previous empirical work reveals that people generally believe that ESP is more plausible and probable than psychokinesis Higher endorsement rates and reported instances evidence this Contrastingly, life after death items do not relate to psychic/mental powers. Instead, they assess belief in spirits and the afterlife. These notions draw on elements of religious belief and spiritualism as acknowledged by the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale .

This distinction is also apparent within Lange and Thalbourne’s Rasch scaling of the ASGS, which identified a New Age-related factor comprising psychokinesis and ESP, and a Traditional Belief dimension composed of life after death items. Consistent with Lange and Thalbourne , the present paper found that exclusion of the life after death or Traditional Belief dimension improved model fit. The life after death subscale undermined scale integrity by adding unnecessary complexity to the measure.

Overall, the present findings supported the veracity of previous research, which has used the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale as an overall and factorial measure of belief in the paranormal. However, conclusions derived from the life after death require further evaluation and replication with more reliable measures. Alternatively, in order to increase life after death construct breadth and subscale integrity researchers could generate and assess the effectiveness of additional afterlife-related items. The life after death subscale focuses particularly on the survival hypothesis. This is a broad construct, which necessitates consideration of related 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p10.1
life after death subscale focuses particularly on the survival hypothesis. This is a broad construct, which necessitates consideration of related concepts, such as religious beliefs and spiritualism. The Revised Paranormal Belief Scale acknowledges this. Additionally, reference to ghosts and hauntings would prove useful because these subjects are associated with the afterlife and represent commonly endorsed paranormal beliefs and frequently reported experiences Given the importance of these phenomena it is odd that they are absent from both the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale . The current study suggests that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p10.18

The notion that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale is superior to the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is unjustified. Rogers et al. claimed that content and psychometric issues undermined Revised Paranormal Belief Scale validity. The present paper found that these measures demonstrated good convergent validity. Both index general paranormal belief and function as equivalent measures. This finding corresponded with Dagnall et al. , who demonstrated that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale produced comparable findings when 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p10.26
Dagnall et al. , who demonstrated that the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale produced comparable findings when assessing relationships between belief in the paranormal and susceptibility to probabilistic biases. Clearly, the present results support the notion that outcomes do not vary as a function of using the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale or RPBS. This seems obvious, but given the previously published criticism, is an important result worth noting. Accordingly, researchers should feel confident when using either measure of paranormal belief.

Study 1 evaluated Australian Sheep-Goat Scale structure via completion of the measure, and Study 2, used a cross-sectional design to further assess Australian Sheep-Goat Scale structure and examine convergent validity between the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and RPBS. This approach was potentially problematic because scores may vary over time. In the context of the current study, this was less of a concern because paranormal beliefs generally remain temporally stable . Additionally, both the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale have previously 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p10.43

Additionally, both the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Revised Paranormal Belief Scale have previously demonstrated satisfactory test–retest reliability indicating that scores remain relatively unchanging. Concerning Australian Sheep-Goat Scale structure, Study 2 replicated the model found in Study 1, indicating that the two-factor bifactor was robust and replicable within an independent sample. Future studies may wish to assess further temporal stability by testing respondents on two different occasions. In addition, the same items loaded highly on psychokinesis relative to a general factor across the two studies.

psychokinesis relative to a general factor across the two studies. Therefore, it would be beneficial for future research to consider controlling for these items (e.g., as a method factor) when utilizing the ASGS. From a psychometric perspective, the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale possesses limitations similar to the RPBS. Particularly, potential response bias arising from an overreliance on positively phrased statements. Typically, scale designers add negative particles (reverse orienting), or use words with an opposite meaning (reverse wording) to counter the tendency to agree to questions (acquiescence bias) or select extreme options (extreme responses) .

agree to questions (acquiescence bias) or select extreme options (extreme responses) . Although, test developers view this as good practice , in the context of belief scales reversed items are highly problematic . Specifically, they are difficult to comprehend and failure to endorse specific items does not indicate disbelief. With complex notions such as ESP, rejecting particular instances does not necessarily indicate lack of belief in the general domain. For example, a person may not believe it possible to predict the future via dreams, but may consider that visions and feelings can foretell forthcoming events. For these reasons, positively worded items 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p10.67
future via dreams, but may consider that visions and feelings can foretell forthcoming events. For these reasons, positively worded items that represent the degree to which respondents endorse the existence of phenomena appear adequate. Indeed, the performance of the one reversed Revised Paranormal Belief Scale item provides support for this contention. This question typically performs poorly in comparison to other scale items (with the exception of the extraordinary life forms subscale). The problem of reversing items generally is that respondents often miss negative content. This is especially true when a reversed statement is located within a block of standardly phrased items 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p10.75
miss negative content. This is especially true when a reversed statement is located within a block of standardly phrased items . This occurs because inattention can produce misappropriate item grouping. This may explain why reversed items frequently load on separate factors and fail to confirm to general factorial models These issues are consistent with the conclusion of Van Sonderen et al. , who contend that reversing items is a counterproductive strategy that results in response contamination arising from respondent inattention and confusion.

The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale is one of the most commonly used measures of paranormal belief, it is therefore essential that researchers appreciate the measure’s advantages and limitations. The present study is important because it provides the background for and an overview of the ASGS. Concomitantly, this article advises on scoring and interpretation.

Generally, the study of paranormal belief is of value because such beliefs are widely held within society they are an important aspect of the human condition , and believers (vs. non-believers) demonstrate important differences (psychological, pathological, sociological, etc.) .

Hence, the investigation of paranormal belief affords insights into everyday cognitions and behaviors and in doing so contributes to several academic disciplines parapsychology, neuroscience, physics, engineering, and biology).

Accordingly, well-designed measures help researchers to identify correlates of beliefs, and in doing so advise the development of complex multivariate models. Recently, these have usefully combined belief with cognitive-perceptual personality factors and preferential thinking style. This approach has resulted in the emergence of dual influence models that apply to other beliefs and behaviors . Additionally, this approach has been highly productive in promoting understanding of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs generally 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale:  p11.45

The Temporal Lobe Symptoms (TLS) inventory is a questionnaire designed to assess the frequency and intensity of symptoms associated with temporal lobe activity, such as déjà vu, auditory and visual hallucinations, and intense emotions. It\'s used to study links between temporal lobe function and various experiences, including those interpreted as paranormal. The Temporal Lobe Symptoms (TLS) inventory typically includes questions about: Déjà vu experiences: Frequency and intensity. Hallucinations: Auditory, visual, and olfactory occurrences. Intense emotions: Sudden, unprovoked emotional changes. Memory lapses: Unexplained gaps or distortions in memory. Unusual perceptions: Sensations of a presence or being watched.

Memory Recall: People tend to remember information that confirms their beliefs more readily than information that disconfirms them. Reinforcement of Beliefs: Encountering supporting evidence, even if weak or anecdotal, can strengthen belief in the paranormal, making it more resistant to change. Research and Investigation: Confirmation bias can affect researchers and investigators, leading them to design studies or interpret data in ways that confirm their hypotheses about the paranormal. Overall, confirmation bias can lead to a skewed perception of evidence, reinforcing belief in the paranormal despite the lack of robust scientific support. #UNSKIP 	ChatGPT :  p5.3
“Apparitions are wavering, uncertain, semi-intelligent things, and the majority of people still regard it as ludicrous to spend time in examining them, while science thrusts them aside as empty stories.” Tyrrell’s “Apparitions”, p. 40 This paper was written in order to provide a summary of research into people’s contemporary experiences of apparitions. The material presented here is different to material presented in other papers at the conference in two main respects: firstly, the majority of material examines experiences from a psychological or parapsychological perspective; and secondly, most of the material 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p108
respects: firstly, the majority of material examines experiences from a psychological or parapsychological perspective; and secondly, most of the material covered here, whether it is from an experiment or an account of an experience, is from present-day sources, as opposed to the early modern period that most of the papers from the conference were covering. The aim of this was to provide the delegates at the conference with an idea of how present-day apparitional experiences are actively researched, in the hope that this might provide fresh perspective on historical and literary accounts of apparitional experiences. Introduction The first major research into 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p108.18
that this might provide fresh perspective on historical and literary accounts of apparitional experiences. Introduction The first major research into the existence of apparitional experiences and the explanations of the causes of apparitions was a census conducted by some of the and the traditions of scientific enquiry that they used to research this continues today. However, apparitional research has always been an area fraught with difficulty when trying to approach it from a parapsychological perspective. When researching cases parapsychologists often encounter two separate problems; emotion and belief. No matter what the perceived cause might be, a person who experiences an 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p108.38
encounter two separate problems; emotion and belief. No matter what the perceived cause might be, a person who experiences an “apparition” associates a certain emotional significance with it. This might be fear due to an unexplainable event or pleasure at seeing a loved one. Whatever the emotional significance might be, the emotional aspects of the experience often influence the reporting of events that the individual experienced. This idiosyncratic influence on the reporting of the event also extends to the personal belief that the individual has applied to the event, which further clouds any “objective facts” that might be gained from the 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p108.58
that the individual has applied to the event, which further clouds any “objective facts” that might be gained from the experience. The beliefs that individuals hold about apparitional phenomena are particularly pertinent here as the commonly held belief is that they are “the spirits of dead people”, often referred to as the spirit hypothesis.2 However, as will be shown here, there have been a number of different explanations offered by researchers to explain the phenomena known as “apparitions”, of which the spirit hypothesis represents only one. Parapsychological research into apparitions has been primarily concerned with defining apparitions, investigating the phenomenological characteristics 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p108.78
spirit hypothesis represents only one. Parapsychological research into apparitions has been primarily concerned with defining apparitions, investigating the phenomenological characteristics of the apparitional experience, and constructing theories about the causes of apparitions. Also outlined here are some of the techniques that have been used in order to investigate the nature of apparitional experiences. Defining apparitions and related phenomena Braude has suggested that it is difficult to describe apparitions without using a particular theoretical framework.3 He initially highlights Price’s definition,4 which he criticised because it used the terms “non-physical”, which implies that it has no objective reality, and the term “human 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p108.99
he criticised because it used the terms “non-physical”, which implies that it has no objective reality, and the term “human being”, which can be criticised not only from the perspective that there are a number of reported cases of the apparitions of inanimate objects , but also from the perspective that many apparitions reported by people are wearing clothes. The second definition Braude criticises is that proposed by Broad6, where he defines all apparitions as being hallucinations, which is a theoretical assumption and automatically dismisses all of the other theories of apparitions, many of which are covered in a later section. 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p109.14
assumption and automatically dismisses all of the other theories of apparitions, many of which are covered in a later section. By doing this Broad’s definition places restrictions on the extent to which apparitional experiences can be discussed. For Broad, they are always hallucinations, and therefore only the nature of the hallucination can be discussed. For the purposes of this paper, an adapted version of Thalbourne’s definition of apparitions will be used. This “working definition” is as follows, “A sensory7 experience in which there appears to be present a person or animal (deceased or living) who is in fact out of sensory 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p109.29
which there appears to be present a person or animal (deceased or living) who is in fact out of sensory range of the experient...”.8 In this definition, there is an attempt to offer a purely descriptive definition of the phenomena experience, which is removed from theoretical constraints. As a consequence of this, the definition is very broad. Although it is not strictly a definition of apparitions, one of the most influential categorisations of the different types of apparitions experienced was proposed by Tyrrell, who divided them into four separate categories; experimental apparitions, crisis apparitions, post-mortem apparitions and finally, ghosts.9 Tyrrell’s 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p109.43
proposed by Tyrrell, who divided them into four separate categories; experimental apparitions, crisis apparitions, post-mortem apparitions and finally, ghosts.9 Tyrrell’s first category, experimental apparitions, refers to cases where a living person has attempted to deliberately make an apparition of themselves appear to another. One of the most famous examples of an experimental apparition was performed and documented by S. H. Beard, in Gurney et al.’s “Phantasms of the Living”. In December 1882, Beard attempted to project an apparition of himself into the house of his fiancée, Miss L. S. Verity. At 9.30 pm he felt as if he had slipped into 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p109.58
the house of his fiancée, Miss L. S. Verity. At 9.30 pm he felt as if he had slipped into a “mesmeric sleep”, where he found himself unable to move.10 At 10 pm he regained full consciousness and made a note of his experience, determined to reattempt the experience at 12 pm in an effort to make the residents of the house aware of his presence. He went to the house the following day and spoke to the married sister of Miss Verity, who was staying in the house at the time. During their conversation she informed him that; “At about 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p109.73
Miss Verity, who was staying in the house at the time. During their conversation she informed him that; “At about half-past nine she had seen me [Beard] in the passage, going from one room to another, and at 12 pm, when she was wide awake, she had seen me enter the bedroom and walk around to where she was sleeping, and to take her hair… into my hand.” After hearing this account, Beard shocked the people present even further by producing the note he had made the night before from his pocket. This experience has to be examined in light 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p109.88
producing the note he had made the night before from his pocket. This experience has to be examined in light of the fact that we do not know what motivations S. H. Beard had for reporting this case, and to the degree he had to prompt Miss Verity to report her experiences of the previous night. These types of cases are rare,12 and it has been suggested that they are very similar to, or possibly the same phenomena as, out-ofbody experiences13. Tyrrell’s second class of apparitions, crisis apparitions, refer to the apparitions of people who are experiencing a crisis event. Death 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.02
Tyrrell’s second class of apparitions, crisis apparitions, refer to the apparitions of people who are experiencing a crisis event. Death is often the crisis event, and in order to qualify as this class of apparition, the apparition has to have occurred no more than 12 hours before or after the event, this “12-hour limit” being arbitrarily drawn by Gurney (as reported by Tyrrell). Tyrrell noted that crisis apparitions have two common features; they appear so similar to real human beings that they are often mistaken for that person until they vanish, and they normally occur when people are engaged in everyday 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.15
they are often mistaken for that person until they vanish, and they normally occur when people are engaged in everyday activities. Tyrrell’s third class of apparition is the post-mortem apparition. This refers to an apparition of a person who has been dead for at least 12 hours, and Tyrrell notes that its characteristics are similar to the crisis apparition in the respect that the figure is often life-like and appears suddenly. The apparition commonly tries to convey information unknown to the witness. One of the most frequently cited post-mortem apparitions is the “Chaffin Will” case.14 James Chaffin was a farmer 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.29
the witness. One of the most frequently cited post-mortem apparitions is the “Chaffin Will” case.14 James Chaffin was a farmer living in North Carolina in the early 1900’s. In 1905 he wrote a will leaving his entire estate to his third son, Marshall, which was attested by two witnesses. In 1919, he appeared to have changed his mind about his will and wrote a second will leaving all of his property equally amongst his four sons. Although this was not witnessed, it was a valid will under North Carolina law, provided that the handwriting could be verified to be his. He 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.42
it was a valid will under North Carolina law, provided that the handwriting could be verified to be his. He hid this copy of the will in the family diary, and wrote a note referring to the will and sewed it into the inside pocket of an overcoat belonging to him, apparently telling no one of either the second will or the note. In September 1921, James Chaffin died due to a fall and all of his property went to his third son, as per the instructions of the original will. In June 1925, James Chaffin’s second son, began to have 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.55
third son, as per the instructions of the original will. In June 1925, James Chaffin’s second son, began to have vivid dreams of his father visiting him at his bedside. In one dream his father appeared to him dressed in his overcoat, pulled it back and said, “ ‘You will find my will in my overcoat pocket.’ ”15 The son then went to his oldest brother’s house, where he found his father’s old overcoat. After undoing the stitching he found the note, and went to his mother’s house with three witnesses, where he found the second will in the family 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.69
the note, and went to his mother’s house with three witnesses, where he found the second will in the family bible. The case then went to court, but the situation was amicably settled out of court prior to the judgement after twelve witnesses, including the wife and son of Marshall (Marshall had died within a year of his father) agreed that the handwriting of the will matched the handwriting of James Chaffin. One unusual feature of this particular case is that it occurred during a dream, although it should be noted that there is the possibility that Chaffin’s second son may 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.82
it occurred during a dream, although it should be noted that there is the possibility that Chaffin’s second son may have forged the note and lied about his experience. Tyrrell’s final class of apparitions are simply called ghosts. Ghosts appear to “haunt” places, where they are commonly seen in the same locality on a number of instances, often by different people.16 Ghosts appear to demonstrate less awareness of their surroundings than other classes of apparition, and seem to have a more limited degree of interaction with witnesses. Tyrrell noted that, “…ghosts are more somnambulistic than other classes of apparition, and seem 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p110.95
limited degree of interaction with witnesses. Tyrrell noted that, “…ghosts are more somnambulistic than other classes of apparition, and seem to be less informed by a definite purpose.”17 Tyrrell’s taxonomy of apparitions has generally received acceptance amongst the parapsychological community,18 although he is quick to note that many apparitional cases might fit into multiple classes, and elements of each individual class can be found in others. Bayless, amongst others, has pointed out that non-human apparitions are also reported, such as animals and luminous lights.19 For example, the apparition of the “black dog” has a long tradition in British folklore.20 Defining 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p111.09
animals and luminous lights.19 For example, the apparition of the “black dog” has a long tradition in British folklore.20 Defining apparitions is one of the most difficult aspects of apparitional research. Many apparitional experiences have to be taken on a case-by-case basis, as the characteristics of the experience seem to defy the taxonomies and definitions that might be employed. Employing a particular taxonomy or definition is thwarted further by the addition of a particular theoretical framework in order to explain the cause of the experience. The phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences are an area that is more easily explored as the 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p111.24
cause of the experience. The phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences are an area that is more easily explored as the characteristics can be more easily catalogued from the different case studies. Incidences of Belief and Phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences Incidents of belief in the existence of apparitions or ghosts (as the two terms are often used interchangeably in questionnaires and do not follow the taxonomy outlined by Tyrrell shown above) vary considerably. Palmer’s survey of residents and students in Charlottesville, Virginia, found that 17 percent of the sample believed that they have had an apparitional experience.21 Irwin found that 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p111.38
Charlottesville, Virginia, found that 17 percent of the sample believed that they have had an apparitional experience.21 Irwin found that 20 percent of the Australian university students in his sample believed in ghosts.22 Haraldsson et al. discovered that 31 percent of Icelandic adults in his sample believed they had seen the apparition of a dead person, and that 11 percent believed they had seen the apparition of a living one.23 One of the highest instances of belief in the existence of ghosts was found by Persinger, who found that 32 percent of the Canadians in his sample had seen an apparition 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p111.52
ghosts was found by Persinger, who found that 32 percent of the Canadians in his sample had seen an apparition of a person or an animal.24 A recent Gallup Poll of a randomly selected, national sample of 1,012 Americans found that 38 percent of the sample believed that, “Ghosts or...spirits of dead people can come back in certain places and situations.”25 It should be noted that the incidences of belief in apparitions have to be moderated by the way that the questionnaires and surveys ask about apparitional belief, as it is difficult to avoid any reference to a particular theoretical framework. 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p111.67
questionnaires and surveys ask about apparitional belief, as it is difficult to avoid any reference to a particular theoretical framework. There is a serious problem when investigating people’s belief in apparitions. There is a difference between having the experience and interpreting the experience (although the two can be interrelated). When discussing apparitions there is a predisposition to assume that you are interpreting all apparitional experiences in terms of the spirit hypothesis (this theory is discussed later). However, this places an interpretation of the experience when describing the experience. This is a problem because it dictates what people report in apparitional 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p111.81
interpretation of the experience when describing the experience. This is a problem because it dictates what people report in apparitional cases and how they respond to apparitional belief questionnaires. For example, if a person feels that a particular experience that they had was not an “apparition” (i.e. the spirit of a dead person), but it had a more conventional explanation, then they are less likely to report it as an apparitional experience. This compounds the problems faced by investigators into apparitional experiences because it means that generally it is only people who believe that they have seen the spirit of a 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p111.95
experiences because it means that generally it is only people who believe that they have seen the spirit of a dead person who report an apparitional experience. The result of this is that they are more likely to alter the narration of their experience to better fit the interpretation they have placed on the experience, with useful pieces of evidence that might lead another person to an alternative interpretation of the experience being intentionally or unintentionally left out of the narration of the experience. Therefore, when evaluating the evidence of people’s belief in the existence of apparitions, one needs to remember 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p112.11
of the experience. Therefore, when evaluating the evidence of people’s belief in the existence of apparitions, one needs to remember that the people surveyed will be placing their own interpretations on the apparitional experiences that others have had.26 Research into the phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences is concerned with, amongst other areas, surveying and cataloguing how different aspects of the apparitional experience can be broken down into duration, realisation by the witness that they are having an experience, what different sensory modalities are activated during an experience. One of the most extensive surveys into the phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p112.26
sensory modalities are activated during an experience. One of the most extensive surveys into the phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences was performed by Green and McCreery, who collected over 850 questionnaires from 1968 to 1974 examining apparitional experiences.27 They found that the 45 percent of people realised that they were having an apparitional experience immediately, 18 percent did not realise they were having such an experience immediately, but knew before they stopped perceiving it, and five percent realised as the experience ended. 31 percent of Green and McCreery’s sample did not realise that they had an apparitional experience until after the 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p112.42
ended. 31 percent of Green and McCreery’s sample did not realise that they had an apparitional experience until after the event. However, Green and McCreery do not make the distinction between witnesses who realised that it was an apparitional event immediately, and those that did not realise this until sometime after the event.28 Green and McCreery also examined the perceived duration of the experience and found that 20 percent of witnesses felt that the experience lasted for five minutes or more, and 42 percent of witnesses said the experience lasted for 15 seconds or less. They also found evidence to suggest 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p112.57
and 42 percent of witnesses said the experience lasted for 15 seconds or less. They also found evidence to suggest that the majority of apparitional experiences were visual , then auditory , tactile , thermal , olfactory (eight percent) and no sense involved (four percent, presumably related to a sense of presence). The majority of cases involved only one sensory modality , but some cases involved two , three (nine percent) or more (five percent) senses being stimulated. As can be seen from the above surveys, people report having apparitional experiences, and although researchers might have difficulty in defining what 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p112.73
be seen from the above surveys, people report having apparitional experiences, and although researchers might have difficulty in defining what an apparitional experience is, members of the public each seem to have their own idea of what an apparition is and what experiencing an apparition entails. However, explaining the causes of the apparitional experience is a very different matter. Theories on the causes of apparitional experiences can be tentatively divided into subjectivist theories, those that assume that the individuals generate apparitions internally; and objectivist theories, which assume that apparitions have some form of objective reality.29 However, it can be argued that 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p112.89
internally; and objectivist theories, which assume that apparitions have some form of objective reality.29 However, it can be argued that some theories can fall into both categories (e.g. an external environmental effect that causes an internal hallucination). The spirit hypothesis has already been mentioned, and is often assumed to be the primary explanation of the causes of apparitions. In its simplest form, it suggests that an apparition is the part of a person that survives bodily death.30 A variation of this hypothesis was suggested by Perry, who suggested a theory to explain the motivations of a small proportion of these “unquiet 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p113.04
hypothesis was suggested by Perry, who suggested a theory to explain the motivations of a small proportion of these “unquiet dead” might include; an attachment to the location or a person they are haunting, a call for assistance (perhaps to help the apparition deal with “unfinished business”), or the intent on behalf of the spirit to offer comfort to a loved one.31 Only a minority of parapsychologists subscribe to the spirit hypothesis now,32 but it is the hypothesis that is most readily imagined by members of the public when the words “apparition” or “ghost” are used. The main problem with 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p113.18
most readily imagined by members of the public when the words “apparition” or “ghost” are used. The main problem with this theory is its lack of falsifiability, i.e. that it is difficult to disprove that all reported cases of apparitions are not the spirits of dead people without researching every case of apparitions. Another problem with this theory is that many apparitions are reported to be wearing clothes or carrying objects, which creates a problem in explaining whether or not objects can survive bodily “death”, however, as apparitions are regularly reported as appearing to have flesh, then it could be equally 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p113.32
can survive bodily “death”, however, as apparitions are regularly reported as appearing to have flesh, then it could be equally as easy for the apparition to appear to be wearing clothes too. There are advantages to this explanation, as it might provide great comfort for those that have an apparitional experience. Some witnesses gain satisfaction that a loved one has visited them, and this might be one possible explanation of why many recently widowed persons report seeing their dead spouse.33 An alternative paranormal explanation to the spirit hypothesis is the super-ESP (extra-sensory perception) hypothesis, which suggests that apparitions are not the 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p113.46
alternative paranormal explanation to the spirit hypothesis is the super-ESP (extra-sensory perception) hypothesis, which suggests that apparitions are not the spirits of the dead, but are the result of a telepathic communication from a living person who knew the dead person.34 Memories about the deceased person are projected by ESP from those who knew them to the person who is having the apparitional experience. The person then sees the apparition, which matches the description of the deceased individual due to the intimate knowledge that was projected by those who knew the deceased. This may well be a variation of Gurney 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p113.61
the intimate knowledge that was projected by those who knew the deceased. This may well be a variation of Gurney et al.’s idea of “contagious telepathy” where they argue that information about an apparitional experience is transmitted through extra-sensory means, almost like an “infection”, which results in others having the same apparitional experience at a later date. Tyrrell examined the idea of telepathic communication of details about a deceased person from a more psychodynamic perspective. He suggested that there was a telepathic communication of an “idea-pattern” into the unconscious mind of the witness, who then used the core material about a 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p113.75
telepathic communication of an “idea-pattern” into the unconscious mind of the witness, who then used the core material about a deceased person to “flesh-out” their experience, resulting in a dramatic and realistic apparitional experience that can be individualistic, yet the apparition shares enough descriptive characteristics with a deceased person to be able to be recognised as that person.35 A main problem with theories that use ESP as a central explanation is that it is still unclear what mechanisms would be employed in order for an individual to acquire information about another’s personality in this manner, but they do begin to offer 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p113.89
in order for an individual to acquire information about another’s personality in this manner, but they do begin to offer an explanation of how some groups of individuals can see an apparition collectively, and how information unique to the deceased person who appeared as an apparition can still described by witnesses of the apparition. Another class of theory suggests that apparitions are just hallucinations originating from the mind of the witness. Podmore suggested that all reported cases of apparitions are the result of misinterpretations of ordinary events and the imagination of the witness (i.e. hallucinations). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p114.03
the result of misinterpretations of ordinary events and the imagination of the witness (i.e. hallucinations). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, defines hallucinations as, “a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ.”36 However, the DSM IV does note that it is possible to have transient hallucinations without having a mental disorder. This is important as it suggests that almost anyone can have a full hallucinatory experience, and it is not restricted to individuals with mental disorders. This is similar to an 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p114.17
have a full hallucinatory experience, and it is not restricted to individuals with mental disorders. This is similar to an argument proposed by Bentall, who has examined the characteristics of hallucinations. His conclusions are particularly relevant to apparitional research, as his extensive literature review found that it is possible to experience hallucinations due to a stressful experience, such as the loss of a spouse, which might explain why many widowed persons reported sightings of the loved one they have lost. He also found that it is possible to hallucinate by hyperventilating, which could lead to a “feedback” model where a 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p114.32
He also found that it is possible to hallucinate by hyperventilating, which could lead to a “feedback” model where a person misperceives a conventional event, panics and begins to hyperventilate, which results in a hallucination of an apparition. Bentall also found that hallucinations are related to the personality of the witness, and hallucinators do not hallucinate random events, “… visual hallucinators see visions of dead ancestors and other persons of psychological significance to them.” 37 Bentall also found evidence that suggestion alone can create hallucinations in some participants.38 This is important to apparitional research, as some investigators have proposed that suggestion 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p114.46
alone can create hallucinations in some participants.38 This is important to apparitional research, as some investigators have proposed that suggestion alone can produce a paranormal experience. Orne suggested that demands of a social situation could influence a participant’s behaviour.39 He found that when a participant was expecting to be put into an altered state of consciousness, they would behave as if they were in the altered state, even if no attempt was made to put them in such a state. This idea was applied to apparitional research by Lange et al., who analysed 924 reported cases of apparitional experiences and found 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p114.6
idea was applied to apparitional research by Lange et al., who analysed 924 reported cases of apparitional experiences and found that nearly 62 percent of the cases were rated as displaying demand characteristics; namely that there was a direct or indirect suggestion to the witness that the environment would produce paranormal phenomena.40 Lange and Houran tested this idea by taking 22 participants individually around five different areas of a dilapidated theatre, which was normally closed to the public. Eleven of the participants were told that the research was concerned with investigating paranormal activity at the theatre. The other eleven participants 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p114.74
the participants were told that the research was concerned with investigating paranormal activity at the theatre. The other eleven participants were informed that the premises were under renovation and the research was examining people’s reactions to such environments. Participants were asked to report any experiences that they had in the theatre by completing a experiential questionnaire. They found that the “paranormal” group reported significantly more physical, mental, extra-personal and transpersonal experiences than the “renovation” group, and the “paranormal” group also reported more intense emotional reaction to the location compared to the “renovation” group, even though the only difference between the two 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p114.88
more intense emotional reaction to the location compared to the “renovation” group, even though the only difference between the two groups was what they were told about the place beforehand.41 This idea was tested by Wiseman et al., who took 678 participants around The Haunted Gallery and Georgian Rooms at Hampton Court. Half of the participants were told that the “haunted” area they were about to visit was associated with a recent increase in reports of unusual phenomena, the other half of the participants were told of no such reports. Wiseman et al. found that this suggestion had no significant effects 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p115.02
of the participants were told of no such reports. Wiseman et al. found that this suggestion had no significant effects on the participants’ expectations of experiencing unusual phenomena during the experiment, or on the number of unusual experiences they reported, or to the degree they attributed an unusual experience to a ghost. However, Wiseman et al. suggest that this might have been because The Haunted Gallery has a reputation for being haunted, and that the suggestion component was a subtle one.42 When this was combined with the demand characteristics of the participants, it reduced the affect of suggestion given by 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p115.16
one.42 When this was combined with the demand characteristics of the participants, it reduced the affect of suggestion given by the experimenters. The issue of group conformity could have also played a part, as it can do when witnesses are describing spontaneous case experiences. Asch found that individual opinion has a tendency to move towards an average opinion held by a group. This is a danger in apparitional reports where an individual’s description of the characteristics of an experience might change in order to become more like the experiences reported at the same time by others, rather than retaining the uniqueness 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p115.3
in order to become more like the experiences reported at the same time by others, rather than retaining the uniqueness of the experience.43 As can be seen, there are a complex set of psychological interactions and motivations in apparitional experiences. Another such psychological motivation for reporting an apparitional experience is fraud. Witnesses might decide to put forward fraudulent claims either intentionally or unintentionally, for numerous reasons, but two possible reasons are those that are seeking attention and those that desire profit. An investigation into a reported apparitional experience by academic or non-academic researchers can involve a great deal of work and 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p115.44
An investigation into a reported apparitional experience by academic or non-academic researchers can involve a great deal of work and research, and a considerable amount of time having to be spent with the witness. Whatever the witness’s particular psychological need might be, it can often be represented as a need for attention, which is satisfied by the investigators. This can lead to the experience being elaborated and/or reported as occurring on multiple occasions so that the investigator might be required to spend more time with the witness. Profit seekers might be seeking to create an aura of mystery and “paranormal 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p115.58
to spend more time with the witness. Profit seekers might be seeking to create an aura of mystery and “paranormal activity” around the location in order to encourage people to go there. This is obviously a tactic that would be primarily used for locations open to the public. An alternative set of theories examines the environment, instead of the paranormal or psychological, as a possible cause of apparitional experiences. Roll and Nichols44 are among a number of researchers who have examined electromagnetic causes for apparitional experiences.45 They investigated 12 sites where, “unexplained footsteps, apparitions, electrical disturbances, strange behaviour by pets and 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p115.72
electromagnetic causes for apparitional experiences.45 They investigated 12 sites where, “unexplained footsteps, apparitions, electrical disturbances, strange behaviour by pets and other haunt phenomena were reported.”46 When investigating these sites, they measured electromagnetic fields (EMF), geomagnetic fields (GMF) and ion densities. According to Roll and Nichols, transient EMFs are found in houses with inadequate grounding, and are generated by electronic equipment. GMFs are generally stable, although there are daily fluctuations from the sun, cosmic rays, the weather, etc., and local conductors (e.g. water and ore bodies) may generate field fluctuations in the local GMF. Persinger, Tiller and Koren have suggested that exposure 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p115.86
water and ore bodies) may generate field fluctuations in the local GMF. Persinger, Tiller and Koren have suggested that exposure to bursts of these variations in the magnetic fields may result in apparitional experiences.47 These experiences might also be tied into concentrations of positive ions, which are associated with effects on mood, such as “...increased irritability, depressive moods and restricted respiration.”48 Roll and Nichols found that out of 12 of the sites they investigated at which apparitional phenomena had been reported, three sites showed transient EMF increases , six sites showed GMF that were higher than the norm , and 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116
reported, three sites showed transient EMF increases , six sites showed GMF that were higher than the norm , and high positive ion levels were found at seven of the 12 sites. These readings tentatively suggest that increased and transient electromagnetic field strengths, combined with the mood altering properties of increase positive ion densities might lead to an apparitional experience, although more comparative research of locations where apparitions have been seen, and places where no paranormal phenomena have been reported needs to be performed. One of the most recent theories of the causes of apparitions involves the effects that infrasound has 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116.14
to be performed. One of the most recent theories of the causes of apparitions involves the effects that infrasound has on the human body. Back in 1998, Vic Tandy (a researcher at Coventry University), reported on an experience he had when working as an engineering designer.49 When working one night in a laboratory that had a history of being haunted, he began to feel increasingly uncomfortable and depressed, and he was sweating and felt as though there was something else in the room. After having a brief break, he continued to write at his desk, and saw a figure appear in 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116.27
the room. After having a brief break, he continued to write at his desk, and saw a figure appear in the periphery of his vision which was grey and made no sound. He was terrified, but turned to face the apparition. When he did it disappeared. The next day he returned to the lab to fix a foil blade for a fencing competition he was entering. When he placed the foil in his bench-vice, it began to frantically vibrate up and down. He began to feel frightened again, but realised for the foil to vibrate it must be receiving energy 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116.41
and down. He began to feel frightened again, but realised for the foil to vibrate it must be receiving energy from somewhere. By experimentation with the blade it was possible to show that low frequency sound (infrasound) was present, specifically a standing wave with a frequency of 18.98 Hz. This frequency is too low for the human ear to hear50, so Tandy could not hear this sound wave. Tandy then proceeded to find out that an infrasound wave of this frequency can vibrate the whole body, which can cause hyperventilation and panic attacks, and can vibrate the eyes, which can cause 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116.55
can vibrate the whole body, which can cause hyperventilation and panic attacks, and can vibrate the eyes, which can cause a blurring of sight, particularly in the peripheral vision, all of which is consistent with his experience. Tandy also managed to trace the cause of the infrasound wave to a faulty fan, and when the fan was repaired the infrasound wave and the ghost seemed to disappear. Tandy has suggested that infrasound waves might account for certain apparitional sightings, but infrasound waves can be transient and are difficult to detect.51 Tandy is continuing this research and is trying to develop an 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116.68
waves can be transient and are difficult to detect.51 Tandy is continuing this research and is trying to develop an infrasound detector which is affordable and takes valid measurements of infrasound, the initial tests of the detector seem promising and are necessary in order to test this theory further.52 Only a small number of the proposed causes of apparitions are shown here, but it can be seen that the suggestion that apparitions are the “spirits of the dead”, is only one possible theory amongst many. It is unlikely that one individual theory can explain all reported cases of apparitional phenomena, 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116.82
one possible theory amongst many. It is unlikely that one individual theory can explain all reported cases of apparitional phenomena, and each case needs to be evaluated individually. It is possible that a combination of different theories needs to be employed in order to understand why people experience apparitions. For example, a person might see an apparition because they are in a nervous state in a location that is reportedly haunted, and yet unconsciously they want to see an apparition. After misperceiving a sound behind them, they turn around and see a hallucination of a person due to their emotional state. 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p116.95
misperceiving a sound behind them, they turn around and see a hallucination of a person due to their emotional state. They then proceed to tell others about their experience, moderating the report so it more closely matches what others have reported. Approaches to researching apparitional experiences from a parapsychological perspective Researching apparitional experiences is difficult. Witnesses are often emotional, can forget important details about a case and often frame the experience in terms of the spirit hypotheses. As the spirit hypothesis is very difficult (if not impossible) to test, researchers into apparitional experiences must therefore gain data on the experiences 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p117.12
hypothesis is very difficult (if not impossible) to test, researchers into apparitional experiences must therefore gain data on the experiences and examine testable hypotheses on the causes of apparitions. Often, the testable hypotheses are those hypotheses that suggest apparitional phenomena are caused by conventional means. Research into apparitional experiences appears to have generally taken the form of four different types of methodology: survey research, laboratorybased replications, field-based experiments, and “ghost hunter” type investigations. These four methodologies are summarised below: Survey Research Survey research into apparitional experiences takes general information from a large number of witnesses and combines them in order to 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p117.29
Survey research into apparitional experiences takes general information from a large number of witnesses and combines them in order to give a general impression of the characteristics of the apparitional experience. There is normally little or no attempt at trying to see if the phenomena can be explained by conventional causes in this type of research. However, data on the phenomenology and belief that surveys collect can be analysed to see if there are common themes to most experiences. One of the most extensive surveys performed on apparitional experiences was done by Green and McCreery.53 From 1968 to 1974 they had 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p117.47
the most extensive surveys performed on apparitional experiences was done by Green and McCreery.53 From 1968 to 1974 they had a number of postal and radio appeals for first-hand accounts of apparitional experiences. They ended up with 850 completed questionnaires as a product of these appeals. Their questionnaires investigated a number of issues about apparitional experiences, such as: emotional response, time of experience, activity the witnesses were engaged in, what sensory modalities the experience activated, number of experiences, how the experience began and ended, and also about apparitions of the living, dead, animals and objects. Their research provided a great 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p117.65
experience began and ended, and also about apparitions of the living, dead, animals and objects. Their research provided a great deal of information about the phenomenology and correlates of the apparitional experience. Another area of survey research is examining how many people believe in the existence of ghosts. One of the most recent surveys was the Gallup Poll, where a telephone survey of 1,012 American adults revealed that 38 percent of the sample believed in the existence of ghosts. Trying to replicate an apparitional experience under laboratory conditions is difficult and problematical at best due to the spontaneous nature of the 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p117.83
replicate an apparitional experience under laboratory conditions is difficult and problematical at best due to the spontaneous nature of the phenomena and the ethical issues in performing research of this type. However, it is possible to place an individual into a “psychomanteum”, where they might have an apparitional experience. The term “psychomanteum” has been defined as, “spirits of the dead are summoned as a means of divination so that they can be asked questions about the future or other hidden knowledge.”55 However, in the laboratory the psychomanteum is a booth or chamber which has black curtains all around it. Inside the 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p118
However, in the laboratory the psychomanteum is a booth or chamber which has black curtains all around it. Inside the booth there is a comfortable chair and a mirror on one of the walls. The mirror is angled so that the person sitting in the chair cannot see their own reflection. A candle is normally placed behind the person to create subdued light. The individual then sits in the chair and relaxes, and begins to stare at the mirror. Some studies have found that over half of the participants who have been in the psychomanteum report experiencing the visual appearance 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p118.16
studies have found that over half of the participants who have been in the psychomanteum report experiencing the visual appearance of a deceased person,56 and that this encounter can be very vivid and in different sensory modalities, with some participants being convinced that the person is there. This method can be helpful in the grieving process57 and the experience can be enhanced by the suggestion that the individual will see a deceased person. Sherwood has suggested that this experimental set-up could result in the participant experiencing hypnogogic or hypnopomic imagery58, which might help to explain why, in Green and McCreery’s sample, 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p118.31
result in the participant experiencing hypnogogic or hypnopomic imagery58, which might help to explain why, in Green and McCreery’s sample, approximately a quarter of the apparitional experiences they analysed occurred when the witness was waking up.59 Field-based Experiments Experiments that are based at a reportedly haunted location obviously lack the degree of control that is possible when an experiment is performed in the laboratory. However, by omitting or manipulating the information that participants receive, it is possible to uncover some of the psychological and environmental cues that make an individual more likely to have an apparitional experience. A key example of 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p118.46
the psychological and environmental cues that make an individual more likely to have an apparitional experience. A key example of a field-based experiment was the experiment performed by Lange and Houran in a disused theatre which was mentioned earlier,60 but another example was the experiment conducted by Maher and Hansen.61 Their experiment involved taking a group of “sensitives” (those that felt they could sense an apparition) individually around a reportedly haunted residential building in New York City. Both groups were asked to note down where in the building they felt that a ghost might be. Maher and Hansen found no 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p118.62
asked to note down where in the building they felt that a ghost might be. Maher and Hansen found no significant different between the accuracy of the sensitives and skeptics guesses when comparing both groups to previously reported sightings.63 These field experiments are useful for further understanding the apparitional experience, but in these types of experiment very little attempt is made to find out what the cause of previous reports of apparitional experiences might be. “Ghost hunter” Type Investigations This is probably the most traditional form of research into apparitional experiences, and is also the best known.

probably the most traditional form of research into apparitional experiences, and is also the best known. The techniques are reviewed by a number of popular books,64 and a number of local and national organisations actively research cases in this manner. Although individual investigators have their own, distinctive styles, in general the investigation proceeds in the following order after the case has come to the attention of the investigators; initial interview of witnesses, visit the site of the experiences and examine it, take photographs and make a plan of the site, perform a thorough investigation of the site, including locations of any 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p118.92
take photographs and make a plan of the site, perform a thorough investigation of the site, including locations of any objects (e.g. hidden pipes) that might offer a conventional explanation of the experiences. Then the investigation might extend to staying at the location during the day or overnight so that the investigators can witness the phenomena first-hand. Different types of equipment might be used, such as cameras, camcorders, electromagnetic-field measuring equipment, night-vision goggles and flour (for footprints). The equipment and the procedure used often depend upon the types of hypotheses that the investigators might be examining. For example, if the 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p119.08
the procedure used often depend upon the types of hypotheses that the investigators might be examining. For example, if the investigators feel from the initial interview with the witnesses that the cause of the phenomena might be due to misinterpretation of conventional events on behalf of the occupiers, they might try to show how this might have happened. Unfortunately, investigations are rarely this straightforward. Because of the fact that spontaneous case investigations take place in the “real-world” and not the laboratory, it is difficult for the investigators to limit the amount of variables that they are to measure and test, and 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p119.23
it is difficult for the investigators to limit the amount of variables that they are to measure and test, and it is therefore difficult to conclude anything definitive from a single-case investigation, unless it has a very clear conventional explanation. This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that many cases are brought to the attention of investigators because the witnesses feel that the location is haunted by the spirit of a dead person. This means that the witnesses’ interpretation moderates their reported experience and their expectations of the findings of the investigators. This can potentially lead to an ethical problem 	Early Modern Ghosts:  p119.38
their reported experience and their expectations of the findings of the investigators. This can potentially lead to an ethical problem for the investigators if they find a conventional cause for the phenomena that the witnesses feel is comforting and paranormal in origin; do the investigators report their actual findings and risk upsetting the witness? Or do they lie and confirm the witnesses’ expectations? Do ghosts exist? – Summary and Conclusions This paper summarises only a fraction of the literature on researching apparitional experiences from a parapsychological perspective.

researching apparitional experiences from a parapsychological perspective. However, it does present some of the difficulties in researching apparitional experiences. Not only is the term “apparition” difficult to define, but also the fact that “ghost” and “apparition” are so easily associated with the spirit hypothesis creates further difficulties in trying to tease out the experience from the interpretation. Hopefully the problems and issues highlighted here will provide researchers who are examining material from the early modern period with more tools and a wider perspective.

Interdisciplinary interactions are very useful, and hopefully parapsychologists and other researchers examining contemporary reports can learn a lot from the techniques that are used to research historical cases, such as the methods that are employed and the types of conclusions that can be drawn. This paper has highlighted the difficulty in answering the question, “Do ghosts exist?” People have apparitional experiences and appear to believe in the existence of ghosts, but there are other possible explanations apart from the spirit hypothesis for explaining the causes of these experiences.

four-year longitudinal research programme investigating the effect of local geomagnetic field fluctuations and meditation on receptive psi has been initiated at a Tibetan monastery in Scotland. This Note is intended to give the theoretical background for this research programme. Research findings from several disparate disciplines have been synthesized into a model that can be used to understand associations of both environmental variables and a person’s state of consciousness with an individual’s performance in controlled psi tests. Initially a description of the evidence for both geomagnetic activity (GMA) and meditation relationships with 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p0
performance in controlled psi tests. Initially a description of the evidence for both geomagnetic activity (GMA) and meditation relationships with psi is presented. Since Geomagnetic Activity exhibits variation by season, and possibly lunar phase, relationships between these cycles and psi are also considered. A theory that connects these variables is then presented, drawing on evidence that Geomagnetic Activity may affect the function of the pineal gland within the human brain, and research that suggests that the pineal gland may produce psi-conducive neurochemicals.

These plasma ejections can be due to spectacular explosions on the sun, known as solar flares, which are most common at the peak of the sun’s approximately 11-year activity cycle, or they can be due to coronal holes, lower density areas of the sun’s atmosphere, that have ‘open’ 1An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 53rd 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p0.59

Disturbances at different frequencies have different source mechanisms; elucidation of the different processes involved in their generation is an active field of space research . For an extensive overview of the Earth’s magnetic field and GMA, the interested reader is referred to Campbell . The Link between Geomagnetic Activity and Psi For the past three decades, research in parapsychology has found evidence that psi is related to GMA. This research can be divided into laboratory versus spontaneous studies, and receptive psi (e.g., clairvoyance) versus active psi (e.g., 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p1.1
GMA. This research can be divided into laboratory versus spontaneous studies, and receptive psi (e.g., clairvoyance) versus active psi (e.g., psychokinesis (PK), healing). The first research into the link between spontaneous receptive psi and Geomagnetic Activity was by Schaut and Persinger . Examining cases from Ian Stevenson’s collection of cases , the Society for Psychical Research case collection Phantasms of the Living , and Fate magazine’s collection , they reported that spontaneous telepathic impressions tended to occur on days of low GMA. Persinger considers that these correlations hold over decades as well as shorter time spans, there being some decades that 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p1.25
GMA. Persinger considers that these correlations hold over decades as well as shorter time spans, there being some decades that have noticeably lower Geomagnetic Activity than others . Wilkinson and Gauld criticised this research for use of inappropriate statistical methods, in particular, failure to account for the skewed distribution of Geomagnetic Activity indices. They also analysed spontaneous case collections, including those used by Persinger, and did not find the above correlations. The first suggestion that the results of laboratory studies of receptive psi may be linked with Geomagnetic Activity was made by Adams , who found that ganzfeld and remote viewing success 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p1.4
psi may be linked with Geomagnetic Activity was made by Adams , who found that ganzfeld and remote viewing success was greater during periods of low GMA. Makarec and Persinger analysed a forced-choice card guessing experiment and found a similar relationship. Tart conducted two psi studies and reported that his results suggested that low Geomagnetic Activity on or immediately preceding the day of an experiment was associated with successful psi. Persinger and Krippner , analysing the Maimonides studies, again found that dream psi was stronger during periods of low GMA. Krippner and Persinger analysed a single dreamer over 20 nights and 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p1.55
dream psi was stronger during periods of low GMA. Krippner and Persinger analysed a single dreamer over 20 nights and found that there was significantly higher dream-psi scoring on nights of low GMA. Haraldsson and Gissurarson found no relationship between Geomagnetic Activity on the day of experiments and psi results, but reported that successful experiments tended to be carried out a day after high GMA. Spottiswoode analysed 305 remote viewing trials and found that success was greater during periods of low GMA. In a meta-analysis of 51 studies comprising 2,879 free-response trials, Spottiswoode reported only a marginally significant relationship between Geomagnetic Activity 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p1.69
In a meta-analysis of 51 studies comprising 2,879 free-response trials, Spottiswoode reported only a marginally significant relationship between Geomagnetic Activity and psi effect size. The link between low Geomagnetic Activity and psi did not hold with Honorton’s database of 139 ganzfeld sessions , nor for the PEAR database of 334 precognitive remote perception trial . Radin found that animal psi research by Sheldrake showed an effect of GMA, in that the participating dog indicated greater awareness of when his owner was returning home on days of low GMA. From the foregoing it is clear that, most often, when a relationship between receptive 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p1.84
home on days of low GMA. From the foregoing it is clear that, most often, when a relationship between receptive psi and Geomagnetic Activity is reported, the correlation is negative; that is to say, psi is more successful when Geomagnetic Activity is low. Occasionally, however, the opposite is reported. Radin, McAlpine and Cunningham found that although “normal” participants showed no evidence of psi, they scored better when Geomagnetic Activity was low, but “creative” participants, who did succeed in the ganzfeld sessions, showed stronger psi scoring when Geomagnetic Activity was high. In receptive psi experiments during which artificial complex fluctuating magnetic fields 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p1.99
showed stronger psi scoring when Geomagnetic Activity was high. In receptive psi experiments during which artificial complex fluctuating magnetic fields were generated near participants, both Persinger, Cook and Tiller and Booth, Charette and Persinger exhibited successful psi during high GMA. Ryan found that psi was associated with low Geomagnetic Activity using both local and global measurements . Ryan collated results from 343 ganzfeld and remote viewing sessions conducted within the UK and checked for correlations with local GMA, using Fourier transforms to condense 1-second field readings from local magnetometers into activity measurements within various frequency bands. He found that low frequency geomagnetic 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p2.27
condense 1-second field readings from local magnetometers into activity measurements within various frequency bands. He found that low frequency geomagnetic pulsations were in general associated with poor psi performance, whereas higher frequency pulsations were associated with enhanced psi performance. He suggested that these results may explain the inconsistent relationship between psi and GMA. The low frequency band correlates well with the global Geomagnetic Activity ap index and therefore this class of activity may explain the associations of psi with low Geomagnetic Activity that are most commonly reported. The high frequency band is generally uncorrelated, but occasionally positively correlated with the global 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p2.57
Activity that are most commonly reported. The high frequency band is generally uncorrelated, but occasionally positively correlated with the global Geomagnetic Activity ap index, 2Ryan re-analysed this study and found a smaller but still significant effect . so this could account for the occasional contrary finding of an association of receptive psi with high GMA. Findings of a positive correlation of Geomagnetic Activity with psi, whilst unusual with receptive psi, seem to be the norm with spontaneous cases of bereavement hallucinations, hauntings and active psi laboratory research.

and active psi laboratory research. In particular, research into spontaneous cases has found strong evidence that sudden increases in Geomagnetic Activity are associated with poltergeist , and haunting episodes . Persinger also found that bereavement hallucinations occurred more frequently during days of high GMA. Persinger and Cameron suggested that local fluctuations in the geomagnetic field may be involved, as their poltergeist cases all occurred close to a geological fault line. Krippner, et al. reported a significant relationship between both local Geomagnetic Activity and the daily Southern Hemisphere Geomagnetic Activity index for the Southern Hemisphere, and apparent anomalous events that occurred in the 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p3.09
and the daily Southern Hemisphere Geomagnetic Activity index for the Southern Hemisphere, and apparent anomalous events that occurred in the presence of a Brazilian “sensitive”. Geomagnetic Activity was heightened on those days when there were maximum anomalous events. This same relationship also holds with laboratory research into active psi. Braud and Dennis examined four sets of their biological psychokinesis data: spontaneous electrodermal activity, mental influence on electrodermal activity, rate of haemolysis of blood cells in vitro and mental influence on haemolysis rate. They found significant correlations for most of the measures, such that greater effects were shown on days of increased 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p3.27
rate. They found significant correlations for most of the measures, such that greater effects were shown on days of increased GMA. It may be that low Geomagnetic Activity is related to receptive psi and high Geomagnetic Activity to active psi, but it is not clear why bereavement hallucinations and haunting phenomena fall into the latter category. One possibility is that haunting phenomena may be closely related to poltergeist phenomena, which are normally considered to be a form of recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis. Both involve movement of objects, variations in air temperature, etc., including occasional reports of apparitions, which is the main feature of 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p3.43
involve movement of objects, variations in air temperature, etc., including occasional reports of apparitions, which is the main feature of bereavement hallucinations. There is some discussion in parapsychology whether receptive and active psi is a unitary phenomenon or two different phenomena . Perhaps, by investigating more closely the effect of the different bands found in local GMA, the anomalies concerning the psi-GMA relationship sometime being positive and sometimes negative, can be clarified. Ryan’s hypotheses about the different effects being related to the different bands of Geomagnetic Activity can only be explored by looking at local GMA, thus reinforcing Hubbard and May’s 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p3.61
the different bands of Geomagnetic Activity can only be explored by looking at local GMA, thus reinforcing Hubbard and May’s concern over the use of global measurements. The Link between Season and Psi Geomagnetic Activity is subject to pronounced seasonal variations, with the most intense disturbances tending to occur in the equinox months of March/April and September/October. Geomagnetic pulsations also vary by season, but these patterns are more complex and depend on pulsation frequency, latitude, time of day, and solar cycle phase . If psi is affected by GMA, one might expect to see a seasonal variation in the results of psi 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p3.77
. If psi is affected by GMA, one might expect to see a seasonal variation in the results of psi experiments. In an examination of 3,325 free response receptive psi trials, Sturrock and Spottiswoode found exactly this, the main effect being a drop in psi effect size from late May to early July. Earlier, in his previous meta-analysis, Spottiswoode had reported a relationship between receptive psi and local sidereal time (LST). LST is time measured relative to the stars: thus at the September equinox, local clock time and LST coincide, then LST recesses by approximately 4 minutes each day, until again coinciding 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p3.95
September equinox, local clock time and LST coincide, then LST recesses by approximately 4 minutes each day, until again coinciding with local time on the equinox of the September of the following year. At any given time of year, local daytime (when most psi experiments are conducted) will fall within a particular LST range, so if psi effect size varies by season, this will be reflected in a non-uniform distribution of psi effect size by LST. Thus, a seasonal factor acting on psi must necessarily explain some, if not all, of the features of psi effect size by LST. Dalkvist and 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p4.1
on psi must necessarily explain some, if not all, of the features of psi effect size by LST. Dalkvist and Westerlund were the first to suggest that Spottiswoode’s findings could be explained if performance was affected by a factor that varied by an interaction of time of day and time of year; i.e. a seasonal effect. In this respect, Spottiswoode’s LST findings can be regarded as primarily due to seasonal effects. The Link between the Moon and Psi An effect of the moon on Geomagnetic Activity has been suggested by various researchers. If this is the case, then apparent lunar phase effects 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p4.24
moon on Geomagnetic Activity has been suggested by various researchers. If this is the case, then apparent lunar phase effects on psi may in fact be attributable to GMA. As in the previous discussion regarding the effect of Geomagnetic Activity on psi, once again we see that both active and receptive psi are affected. With regard to receptive psi, in a series of telepathy tests, Puharich , found increased psi scores at full and dark moon periods, and when Krippner, Becker, Cavallo and Washburn analysed 80 dream sessions, they also noticed enhanced psi during the full moon period. Radin and Rebman 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p4.38
Cavallo and Washburn analysed 80 dream sessions, they also noticed enhanced psi during the full moon period. Radin and Rebman found a lunar correlation in their data of casino jackpot and lottery wins. Over a four year period there were 6 jackpot wins — all of them were during the full moon period. Other games also showed enhanced casino payout during the full-moon period, with peak payout within one day of the full moon. There is no way of telling whether these were due to receptive or active psi! Researching active psi, Etzold evaluated 200,000 retro-PK trials covering 8 years and found 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p4.53
were due to receptive or active psi! Researching active psi, Etzold evaluated 200,000 retro-PK trials covering 8 years and found significant relationships between both solar activity and lunar phase. In some periods retro-PK results were above chance around the full moon period but during other periods the apparent effect was reversed. Sturrock and Spottiswoode’s analysis also suggested that there may be a relationship between psi performance and lunar phase; they found a peak of psi effect size at about twice the lunar synodic frequency. With regard to research linking lunar phase with GMA, there is evidence that the moon affects the intensity 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p4.67
synodic frequency. With regard to research linking lunar phase with GMA, there is evidence that the moon affects the intensity of the geomagnetic field via atmospheric tidal effects , but no influence on the global index of Geomagnetic Activity ap has been detected . However, it is possible that lunar effects may be more prominent in other components, such as pulsation classes, of Geomagnetic Activity . Schneider hypothesised that the moon may interact with the magnetotail (the narrow, elongated area of the Earth’s magnetic field that extends away from the sun) during the full-moon period, thereby modulating GMA. Etzold, suggested that 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p4.82
the Earth’s magnetic field that extends away from the sun) during the full-moon period, thereby modulating GMA. Etzold, suggested that this could be the mechanism behind the lunar influence on psi. The plausibility of this account seems questionable because the moon has no global magnetic field and thus one would imagine that the interaction between the moon and plasma streams is negligible . However recent observations from NASA’s Lunar Prospector spacecraft suggest that the moon may affect processes in the magnetotail at larger distances upstream than previously considered , so the question remains open. Distinguishing a lunar from a solar effect can 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p4.96
larger distances upstream than previously considered , so the question remains open. Distinguishing a lunar from a solar effect can be problematic because the interval between two successive lunar phases (the synodic period) of 29.5 days is close to the rate of solar rotation, which is approximately 27 days. As the sun is a gaseous body, its rotation varies by latitude and is fastest at the equator. In addition, features such as sunspots can shift in position from one rotation to the next. This can make it challenging to differentiate between solar and lunar effects, particularly when short periods are studied. 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p5.13
the next. This can make it challenging to differentiate between solar and lunar effects, particularly when short periods are studied. THEORETICAL MODEL The Link between Geomagnetic Activity and the Pineal Gland Persinger , Roney-Dougal and Roney-Dougal and Vogl have all suggested that the Geomagnetic Activity relationship with psi might be connected with the pineal gland. In general, there is considerable empirical evidence that magnetic fields, both artificial and natural, can affect one’s state of consciousness in many ways. Randall and Randall found a relationship between natural magnetic disturbances caused by the solar wind and hallucinatory experiences. Fuller, Dobson, Wieser and Moser evoked 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p5.32
a relationship between natural magnetic disturbances caused by the solar wind and hallucinatory experiences. Fuller, Dobson, Wieser and Moser evoked epileptic type activity using magnetic fields, and Dobson, St. Pierre, Wieser and Fuller applied magnetic fields to epileptic patients which changed their brain wave patterns. Biogenic magnetite has been found in the brain, which might provide a basis both for its sensitivity to magnetic fields and a possible magnetic sense of direction . Another potential effect of Geomagnetic Activity on brain activity is the control of chemical reactions within the brain through the coupling of weak low-frequency magnetic fields at sub-atomic levels 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p5.5
is the control of chemical reactions within the brain through the coupling of weak low-frequency magnetic fields at sub-atomic levels . More specifically, Persinger’s studies have associated the temporal lobes with the interaction between magnetic fields and psi. He has shown that anomalous perceptions and impressions can be artificially induced by applying temporally complex, weak-intensity (comparable to GMA) magnetic fields to the brain. Persinger found increased alpha activity over the left temporal lobe following exposure to weak artificial transcerebral magnetic fields in a dark room, and differential entrainment of EEG activity . These impressions increase if the individual has an increased 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p5.69
in a dark room, and differential entrainment of EEG activity . These impressions increase if the individual has an increased susceptibility to temporal lobe epilepsy. Persinger’s theory is that the magnetic fields induce partial micro-seizures in the temporal lobe regions and the hippocampus/amygdala area . This follows on from research by Roll who noticed the excess of poltergeist-focus children who suffered from epilepsy or some other neurological problem. Neppe in his research into spontaneous cases noted a link between psi experience and temporal lobe sensitivity, and Persinger reported that practitioners of Transcendental Meditation displayed increased partial epileptic-type signs, which are related to 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p5.87
temporal lobe sensitivity, and Persinger reported that practitioners of Transcendental Meditation displayed increased partial epileptic-type signs, which are related to the temporal lobes. The pineal gland is associated with the temporal lobes and limbic system. Persinger suggested a role for melatonin, which is made by the pineal gland, in his temporal lobe/limbic system hypothesis . There is also some tentative support for the melatonin-psi hypothesis from dream ESP research that shows increased precognition test scores at 3:00 a.m., when melatonin is being produced, compared to 8:00 a.m. when there is, in general, lower melatonin production , although this effect was not 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p6.06
being produced, compared to 8:00 a.m. when there is, in general, lower melatonin production , although this effect was not replicated in a later study . Reiter and Richardson reviewed the evidence that magnetic fields depress melatonin production by the pineal gland and found that this occurs primarily at night. In more recent research, conducted in the arctic region, Weydahl, Sothern, Cornelissen and Wetterberg found that high Geomagnetic Activity reduced melatonin production and increased serotonin levels. Welker, Semm, Willig, Commentz and Wiltshchko suggest that it is the change in the intensity of the field which affects pineal functioning, rather than the overall 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p6.24
suggest that it is the change in the intensity of the field which affects pineal functioning, rather than the overall level. Furthermore there is a window of magnetic field frequency, typically below 30Hz, which appears to be related to both pineal neural activity and psi-type experiences induced by artificial magnetic fields . Thus, the suggestion is that, as artificial and natural magnetic fields can induce psi-type experiences, and as spontaneous psi occurs in people with epilepsy and other temporal lobe sensitivity, that possibly the pineal gland is a mediator for a psi-conducive state of consciousness being induced by changes in the magnetic 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p6.42
possibly the pineal gland is a mediator for a psi-conducive state of consciousness being induced by changes in the magnetic field. This suggestion is supported by the formation in the pineal gland of psi-conducive neurochemicals which are identical to those found in the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca, used by shamans in the Amazonian region. The Link between the Pineal Gland, Psychedelic Tryptamines and Psi Both Strassman and Roney-Dougal suggest that some psychic, dreaming, psychotic and mystical states may occur through the production of DMT and pinoline in the pineal gland. . Severi , Harvey-Wilson, , McKenna, and Ring, have all noted the 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p6.6
of DMT and pinoline in the pineal gland. . Severi , Harvey-Wilson, , McKenna, and Ring, have all noted the similarity between traditional psychedelic-induced shamanic initiations that include DMT-like substances, NDEs, alien abduction experiences, and heightened psychic sensitivity. Harmala alkaloids (chemically similar to pinoline) and DMT are both found in the Amazonian shamanic brew, Ayahuasca. Ayahuasca was traditionally used by shamans to induce out-of-body and psychic experiences, and for the shamanic healing ritual. The anthropological and ethnobotanical literature is replete with examples of ostensibly paranormal phenomena occurring with the traditional use of psychoactive plants, particularly Ayahuasca . Commonly these plants are taken 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p6.78
of ostensibly paranormal phenomena occurring with the traditional use of psychoactive plants, particularly Ayahuasca . Commonly these plants are taken in a ritual context for the express purpose of accessing altered states conducive to clairvoyance, precognition, telepathy, out-of-body travel, psychic diagnosis, psychic healing, and spirit communication . The common neurotransmitter serotonin is known to be most active in the pineal gland where it follows a circadian rhythm and is converted at night into melatonin and pinoline, which Callaway suggests may regulate the dream cycle. MAO inhibiters, such as pinoline, possibly convert serotonin, with the aid of pineal enzymes, into the potent 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p6.97
the dream cycle. MAO inhibiters, such as pinoline, possibly convert serotonin, with the aid of pineal enzymes, into the potent hallucinogens 5-MeO-DMT, DMT, and bufotenine. In vivo biosynthesis of DMT might also occur through the conversion of the common, nutritionally-essential, amino acid tryptophan . So it is possible that the pineal gland is involved in making neurochemicals which create a psi-conducive state of consciousness particularly at night, but also when there are changes in GMA. To summarise: the pineal gland produces neurochemicals which are identical with those found in a shamanic brew used specifically to induce spiritual, out-of-body and psychic experiences. In 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p7.13
which are identical with those found in a shamanic brew used specifically to induce spiritual, out-of-body and psychic experiences. In general, these are produced at night and are thought to be the stimulus for the dream state of consciousness. Reports of spontaneous precognitive experiences show that the majority occur at night and during dreams . Also, traditionally, mediums used to work in the dark and at night, so it could well be that this is a psi conducive period linked with the pineal gland’s production of pinoline and DMT. The pineal gland is influenced both by the night-day cycle and by changes 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p7.3
pineal gland’s production of pinoline and DMT. The pineal gland is influenced both by the night-day cycle and by changes in GMA. Thus, geomagnetic fluctuations, originating from solar emissions and modulated by seasonal and lunar phase periods, may well be directly stimulating the pineal gland causing secretions of psi-conducive neurochemicals. Further, it is interesting to note that yogic traditions consider the pineal gland to be the physical aspect of ajna chakra, the third eye, which they consider to be the medium for psychic experiences. The Link between Meditation and Psi In the 1970s, Braud introduced the concept of the psi-conducive state. 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p7.47
for psychic experiences. The Link between Meditation and Psi In the 1970s, Braud introduced the concept of the psi-conducive state. This is a model which has driven much parapsychological research since then into altered states of consciousness as conducive to the experience of psi phenomena. The model states that psi functioning is enhanced when there is cortical arousal sufficient to maintain conscious awareness, muscular relaxation, reduction of sensory input, and focus on internal attention. In other words, when the receiver is in a state of sensory relaxation and is minimally influenced by ordinary perception. For more recent reviews of this concept see 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p7.63
a state of sensory relaxation and is minimally influenced by ordinary perception. For more recent reviews of this concept see Braud , Roe and Holt, Simmonds–Moore, Luke and French . Around the same time Honorton was developing his model of internal attention states from his readings of the classic yoga text known as Patanjali’s sutras. These sutras state that when one attains samadhi the “siddhis” (psychic powers) manifest. In meditation there is internal and external noise reduction, and various psycho-physiological correlates, such as EEG alpha rhythm and increased skin resistance, all of which have been found to be associated with greater 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p7.8
such as EEG alpha rhythm and increased skin resistance, all of which have been found to be associated with greater psi scoring . Both Yogic and Buddhist teachings state that as one advances in meditation so psi phenomena start to occur. A more detailed review of this relationship is available in Roney-Dougal , and a fuller discussion of Patanjali’s yoga sutras in relation to psi research has been given by Braud . Research into the effect of meditation suggests that it may indeed be a psi-conducive state and increase receptive psi. This research started in the 1970s and in general found that 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p7.96
indeed be a psi-conducive state and increase receptive psi. This research started in the 1970s and in general found that post-meditation scores were better than pre-meditation, e.g., Schmeidler ; Dukhan and Rao ; Roll and Zill . At the same time a change in methodology occurred with the introduction of free-response techniques. In these procedures the participant verbally described and/or drew their experience of the psi target prior to viewing the target. In other words, they attempted to become consciously aware of the target, in contrast to research which measures the physiological response of the participant to the target, or forced-choice techniques 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p8.12
the target, in contrast to research which measures the physiological response of the participant to the target, or forced-choice techniques where the person guesses the target from a fixed number of known potential targets, e.g., card symbols. A meta-analysis of all the research by 1976 showed that overall there were 9 significant meditation psi experiments out of a total of 16, giving an overall p = 6x10-12 . Schmeidler , who summarised the research from 1978-1992, found that four out of the six studies reported during this period gave significant results. More recent research into the effect of meditation on receptive 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p8.27
the six studies reported during this period gave significant results. More recent research into the effect of meditation on receptive psi includes a ganzfeld study by Symmons and Morris , which found no difference between meditators and non-meditators on accuracy of choosing the target. And in a study looking at subconscious physiological responses to a forthcoming target, known as the presentiment experiment, Radin, Vieten, Michel and Selorme found that advanced meditators with around 20 years of practice showed significant EEG responses before the stimulus was presented. The controls gave no significant prestimulus response. Most of the recent research has looked at the 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p8.42
the stimulus was presented. The controls gave no significant prestimulus response. Most of the recent research has looked at the effect of meditation on active psi, which is not directly relevant to this review. However, the term meditation in all the studies mentioned so far has been used in a very loose way, since many different forms of meditation were practised including: mandala gazing, which is focusing attention on a specific type of picture; pranayama, which comprises a variety of breath techniques; kundalini yoga, which is primarily concentration on energy points called chakras and the energy channels between them; mantra yoga, 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p8.58
techniques; kundalini yoga, which is primarily concentration on energy points called chakras and the energy channels between them; mantra yoga, which is sometimes known as transcendental meditation (TM) and is where certain words are repeated either mentally or out loud; and awareness techniques such as Zen meditation. Clearly, different techniques may result in different states of consciousness, and meditation research has been criticized for assuming that all meditation techniques are the same . A series of studies in India, working initially at an ashram with Yogis and then with Tibetan Buddhist monks , strongly suggested that meditation is related to conscious psi 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p8.73
an ashram with Yogis and then with Tibetan Buddhist monks , strongly suggested that meditation is related to conscious psi awareness, in that meditators with more than 20 years of practice showed more consistent psi-hitting on a receptive psi task compared with beginners; the correlation for the combined Tibetan studies was r = 0. 74, p = 0.0005, confirming that found in the yogic studies . This finding is in line with Yogic and Tibetan teachings, which state that the psi shown by an advanced practitioner is more reliable than the spontaneous psi exhibited naturally by psychics. These studies also looked at 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p8.88
by an advanced practitioner is more reliable than the spontaneous psi exhibited naturally by psychics. These studies also looked at the type of meditation used in the psi sessions. In the ashram a kundalini technique called ajapajapa was specifically used, as yogis consider that it stimulates the ajna chakra, the third eye and psychic centre. The final study with the Tibetans compared mantra meditation with visualisation. Whilst no difference was found in the actual sessions, years of practice with visualisation did show the strongest correlation with psi score , though this was not significant. On balance one can conclude that meditators 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p9.05
show the strongest correlation with psi score , though this was not significant. On balance one can conclude that meditators are potentially a psi-conducive population, and so it was decided to run the longitudinal study into the effect of Geomagnetic Activity on psi with people who had practiced Tibetan Buddhist meditation for a minimum of 10 years. Research suggests elevation of pineal function during meditation , but the potential connection between meditation, the pineal gland and Geomagnetic Activity will not be directly addressed in this study. Summary of the Theoretical Perspective We have seen that thirty years of research strongly suggests a 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p9.27
addressed in this study. Summary of the Theoretical Perspective We have seen that thirty years of research strongly suggests a link in various different ways between Geomagnetic Activity and psi experiences. However there are many anomalies in the findings and the cause of the relationship is still only partially explored. One possibility is that changes in the Geomagnetic Activity may affect the pineal gland to make endogenous neurochemicals which are similar to those used in shamanic rituals. There is strong evidence that the pineal’s activity is affected by GMA. Anthropological and neurochemical evidence points to the role of pinoline made in 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p9.49
that the pineal’s activity is affected by GMA. Anthropological and neurochemical evidence points to the role of pinoline made in the pineal gland creating an endogenous Ayahuasca-type hallucinogen. Amazonian shamans use Ayahuasca for psychic purposes, which suggests that the pineal neurochemicals may be psi-conducive. Yogis consider that meditation can affect one’s psi ability, and there are meditation techniques which specifically target ajna chakra, whose physical location is considered to be the pineal gland. Therefore, it is possible that one potential explanation for the psi-conducive nature of meditation may related to activation of the pineal gland during the practice. These relationships are shown 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p9.71
the psi-conducive nature of meditation may related to activation of the pineal gland during the practice. These relationships are shown in Figure 1. Based on the model described here and illustrated in Figure 1, a long-term study is now underway to explore the effects of local Geomagnetic Activity on psi. One of the key aims of the proposed project is to replicate and extend the work of Ryan , by exploring the features of local Geomagnetic Activity that may modulate performance in receptive psi trials. The GMA-psi literature shows an anomaly in that on some occasions increased Geomagnetic Activity is related to 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p9.94
receptive psi trials. The GMA-psi literature shows an anomaly in that on some occasions increased Geomagnetic Activity is related to psi and on others decreased Geomagnetic Activity is related to psi. This may be connected with differences between active or receptive psi – or it may be that investigating local Geomagnetic Activity where the different bands can be discriminated will resolve the anomaly. By gathering data from the same population over a four year period it will be possible to look at the effect of lunar, seasonal, and sunspot cycles on the GMA-psi correlation. The two main reasons for working with 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI:  p10.16
at the effect of lunar, seasonal, and sunspot cycles on the GMA-psi correlation. The two main reasons for working with meditators is the evidence that they are a potentially psi-conducive population, and the proximity of Samye Ling Tibetan Centre to Eskdalemuir Observatory, which is in the same valley. The Eskdalemuir Observatory is Britain’s first purpose built geological 11 Roney-Dougal, Ryan and Luke Geomagnetic Activity and Psi: Literature Review and Theoretical Model observatory and gathers extremely high quality measurements of the geomagnetic field at a time resolution of 1-second.

at a time resolution of 1-second. An initial two year study has been completed and will be submitted for publication in due course. The primary hypotheses being tested in this study are that psi scoring will be related to the different frequencies (bands) of Geomagnetic Activity , and that psi scoring will be positively correlated with years of meditation practice. A number of other exploratory hypotheses are also being tested such as lunar and seasonal variations in psi and its relationship to temporal lobe lability, and the psychological effects of meditation.

of people who have survived death have captured the attention of mainstream audiences. Why do these ideas enjoy persistent and widespread success in contemporary Western culture? Adopting a cognitive approach to the study of afterlife accounts and drawing upon our own research, we argue that mainstream survival narratives are popular because they provide convincing evidence that one has journeyed to another realm. Such accounts are convincing, in part, because they meet default cognitive assumptions about what human survival would look like if it were possible. We support this claim by highlighting 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p0.01
default cognitive assumptions about what human survival would look like if it were possible. We support this claim by highlighting recurring common themes in recounted episodes of neardeath experiences and past life accounts and outlining how key findings in the cognitive science of religion, in conjunction with culturally situated accounts, can help scholars concerned with ideas about anomalous experiences to better understand their appeal. From around the mid-twentieth century, Western media has capitalized increasingly on accounts of seemingly reputable cases of life after death. The general population is enamoured with tales of people who claim that they experienced rich sensations and 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p0.53
life after death. The general population is enamoured with tales of people who claim that they experienced rich sensations and perceptions while either close to death or clinically dead1 In these NDE narratives, people often describe feelings of detachment from one’s body (often accompanied by seeing one’s own body from above); meeting deceased friends, relatives, or other spirits; undergoing a life review or that of others); feelings of transcending time and space; and sensing that one has journeyed to another world or realm . Other narratives present personal accounts of reincarnation, the idea that after biological death a person leaves his 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p1.05

Other narratives present personal accounts of reincarnation, the idea that after biological death a person leaves his or her mortal body and returns to the human world in another form following rebirth . Often people recount These memories typically take the form of detailed recollections of traumatic life events, such as being separated from loved ones, drowning, or being burned alive. Such first-person material is regular fodder for mainstream news outlets, including the New York Times , high-profile television shows, such as the “Oprah Winfrey Show” and feature in a recent spate of bestselling books From a commercial 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p1.26
television shows, such as the “Oprah Winfrey Show” and feature in a recent spate of bestselling books From a commercial perspective, these survival stories are a huge success. An entire business empire generating hundreds of millions of dollars rests on the persuasiveness of personal accounts of individuals claiming to have had such experiences. How can scholars explain the popularity of these survival accounts? To date, the standard response from social scientists concerned with anomalous experiences3 is to explain the transmissive success of ideas by locating them in a historically situated socio-cultural context. For instance, particular ideas about past lives in contemporary 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p1.48
of ideas by locating them in a historically situated socio-cultural context. For instance, particular ideas about past lives in contemporary America may well have a competitive advantage over other accounts because they are tailored to suit 1 Definitions of what constitutes death vary considerably; here, clinical death means cardiac arrest followed by cessation of measurable brain activity. See Younger, Arnold, and Schapiro for more details. 2 E.g., see Bowman 2012; Edelmann and Bernet 2007; Haraldsson 1997; Lyons 2013; Moye 2014; Stevenson 2001; Tucker 2013; Wallis 1999; Weiss and Weiss 2012. 3 There is debate amongst scholars over how to construe these 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p1.7
2001; Tucker 2013; Wallis 1999; Weiss and Weiss 2012. 3 There is debate amongst scholars over how to construe these phenomena For simplicity, we refer to them here as anomalous experiences. a quintessentially modern, eclectic brand of New Age spirituality and religious individualism that has become immensely popular in the West Albanese 2006; Bender 2007; Dawson 2006; Farias, Claridge, and Lalljee 2005; It is no accident that popular past life narratives often include ideas about the individual’s traumatic past-life experiences and provides guidance for the person to fulfill their potential in their current life. It may also be the case that, 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p1.92
provides guidance for the person to fulfill their potential in their current life. It may also be the case that, for example, remembering something from a previous existence is readily taken as evidence of reincarnation by those who have already become disenchanted with the conventional Judeo- Christian canon. We contend that while cultural factors are necessary to explain the transmissive success of survival narratives, they are not sufficient. Consider the marked variation between NDE accounts. Variation in reports may well be explained by cultural differences and modes of conceptualizing geophysical space. For instance, while experiences of journeys to another realm are 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p2.12
explained by cultural differences and modes of conceptualizing geophysical space. For instance, while experiences of journeys to another realm are found throughout the world, the means of transport vary: in North America, people often speak of traveling though a tunnel, whereas in Melanesia, people tend to report ascending ladders or walking along roads Likewise, the appearance or overall milieu of the afterlife realm can and does often vary significantly. But even among culturally— and individually—idiosyncratic NDEs, the basic structural features of one’s spirit traveling to another realm and interacting with other deceased souls who dwell there are remarkably consistent.4 These similarities 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p2.32
one’s spirit traveling to another realm and interacting with other deceased souls who dwell there are remarkably consistent.4 These similarities must also be explained. Furthermore, they align with basic assumptions about the afterlife that recur cross-culturally: namely, that the essential identity or personality of an individual (i.e., “consciousness”) exists apart from the body, survives biological death, and travels to some other dimension inhabited by social others . It is likely that belief in an inhabited afterlife realm has as much do with our species’ cognitive predispositions as it does fears of one’s own eventual demise, as people tend to view the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p2.52
with our species’ cognitive predispositions as it does fears of one’s own eventual demise, as people tend to view the death of a loved one as resulting in a change to their physical location rather than as an existential annihilation . A cognitive approach thus helps to explain why some survival narratives— including that we survive death, in what form this survival takes, and what constitutes evidence for this survival—enjoy widespread cultural success despite differences in propositional beliefs about life after death.

death. In this paper, 4 Not all researchers agree on what features are universal within NDE accounts. For an overview of cross-cultural comparisons, see Fox , Kellehear , Shushan , Corazza and Kuruppuarachchi . we outline how research in the cognitive science of religion (CSR)—including the results of our own primary research—can shed light on the popularity of two phenomena, near death experiences and past life beliefs, which, although seemingly different in terms of content, are underpinned by similar assumptions about personal survival. In short, we propose that some survival narratives are popular because they are convincing, and they are convincing, 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p2.92
personal survival. In short, we propose that some survival narratives are popular because they are convincing, and they are convincing, in part, because they meet intuitive expectations about what human survival would look like if it were possible. Over the past twenty-five years or so, cognitive science of religion has mounted evidence to suggest that recurrent features of religious and other types of extraordinary phenomena— like other aspects of popular culture—arise in large part through default intuitions about the natural world The rationale behind this empirical discipline is summarized by Boyer and Walker: An account of religious representations requires an explanation 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p3.12
The rationale behind this empirical discipline is summarized by Boyer and Walker: An account of religious representations requires an explanation of their cognitive salience. If we focus on the recurrent patterns underlying the apparent diversity of religious representations, it appears that they are constrained by a small number of principles that are part and parcel of everyday cognition and are not specifically religious in nature. This approach is grounded in a selectionist framework, which proposes that to explain the spread of religious ideas, one must consider, in addition to sociohistorical factors, the role of human cognition in constraining and facilitating their 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p3.32
religious ideas, one must consider, in addition to sociohistorical factors, the role of human cognition in constraining and facilitating their transmission . Thus, cognitive science of religion complements a social learning interpretation by focusing on the common denominators of widespread ideas in survival narratives that, in conjunction with culturally specific ideas, lead to their rapid dissemination. Thus far cognitive science of religion has focused more on the assumptions underpinning postmortem survival to explain traditional theological accounts of life after death, but the approach also has the potential to explain why some descriptions of personal survival in popular Western culture are especially 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p3.53
the approach also has the potential to explain why some descriptions of personal survival in popular Western culture are especially compelling, even when they are divorced from mainstream theological doctrine. From this perspective, the core features of popular survival narratives showcase contemporary Western society’s assumptions about the afterlife, which are largely tractable to panhuman predispositions concerning the representation of persons, minds and bodies. The intuitive appeal of these stories is not limited to those who purport to believe in supernatural phenomena, and thus cannot be explained away as a product of propositional beliefs. For example, although commercial success reveals that past 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p3.73
and thus cannot be explained away as a product of propositional beliefs. For example, although commercial success reveals that past life narratives routinely attract considerable interest and media attention, only around 20 percent of Americans actually believe that reincarnation is possible, and even fewer believe that they themselves have lived before (see Haraldsson 2006; Walter 2001; White, Kelly, and In addition, ideas about reincarnation are often presented as having credence through corresponding parapsychological research5 about what constitutes “legitimate” evidence for life beyond death. For example, the late Ian Stevenson provided the most extensive treatment of past-life research to date, documenting approximately 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p3.94
beyond death. For example, the late Ian Stevenson provided the most extensive treatment of past-life research to date, documenting approximately 3,000 case reports of people from around the world who presumably possessed memories of their previous lives Stevenson 2001; for an overview of Stevenson, see Tucker 2007; see also Tucker From a cognitive perspective, ongoing research on reincarnation depends more upon parapsychologists’ implicit reasoning about how one would verify whether or not it exists than simply believing, ipso facto, that it does exist. These empirical practices for assessing the veridicality of afterlife claims tend to correlate with how ordinary people think 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p4.16
does exist. These empirical practices for assessing the veridicality of afterlife claims tend to correlate with how ordinary people think about consciousness. In what follows, we outline three recurrent themes that appear throughout popular narratives about life after death and showcase how these standard inferences can often be understood within the materialist framework of CSR. I A Cognitive Account of Compelling Survival Narratives A Privileged Knowledge Among the vast array of NDE reports, the most popular—and championed as the most persuasive—are those in which people allegedly acquire information during their death/near-death state or previous life that they could not possibly have 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p4.38
those in which people allegedly acquire information during their death/near-death state or previous life that they could not possibly have known before. These cases are often highlighted because the information contained within them is specific and (according to parapsychologists) later verified as accurate. Both forms of knowledge rely on memories of having lived—and often, having died—before. In the context of past life 5 Although mainstream academics have debated how best to construe the investigation of such phenomena (e.g., as psychical, occult, paranormal, supernatural, etc.), here we refer to research that seeks to determine the veracity of life after death as parapsychology 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p4.61
paranormal, supernatural, etc.), here we refer to research that seeks to determine the veracity of life after death as parapsychology (for an Most scholars regard parapsychology as a field that is not impartial and often fails to follow the rigorous standards of scientific enquiry, noting, for example, that their primary method of empirical investigation—case studies—is subject to confirmation bias narratives, these memories typically take the form of detailed recollections of traumatic life events, such as being separated from loved ones, drowning, or being burned alive. For instance, Stevenson reports the case of Ravi Shankar Gupta as evidence of reincarnation. He recalled 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p4.84
or being burned alive. For instance, Stevenson reports the case of Ravi Shankar Gupta as evidence of reincarnation. He recalled eating guavas before being taken to the riverside where he was murdered. This description was consistent with the murder of a boy named Munna Prasad decades before, and so the memory was interpreted as support for the claim that Gupta was Prasad reborn . Here, the phenomenon of reincarnation is given credence by certain empirical facts: the memory of a distinctive previous-life event conforms to a factual record, one including details of which the person in question would not have any 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p5.05
previous-life event conforms to a factual record, one including details of which the person in question would not have any known access. Popular accounts of NDEs likewise contain the assumption of privileged knowledge. For example, after a patient was pronounced clinically dead, a nurse had removed his dentures and placed them on a nearby tray. Over a week later, the same recovering patient spotted the nurse and exclaimed that she must know where the missing dentures were because he recalled being out of his body during intubation and having witnessed her removing them . For further illustration, consider the case of 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p5.23
out of his body during intubation and having witnessed her removing them . For further illustration, consider the case of social worker Kimberly Clark-Sharp , who reported an NDE case in which she visited a patient in a hospital who was recovering from a heart attack. The patient, named Maria, claimed that while she was being resuscitated she had found herself floating above the hospital, and remembered having noticed a blue tennis shoe on the ledge of the building. Out of curiosity, Clark-Sharp investigated and did, in fact, find a shoe precisely matching the one described by Maria and in the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p5.41
curiosity, Clark-Sharp investigated and did, in fact, find a shoe precisely matching the one described by Maria and in the same spot where Maria reported seeing it. This particular example, notable for its specific imagery, is often presented as one of the strongest to suggest that memories of out-of-body perceptions occurring during NDEs coincide with objective reality, and as such this case is routinely presented (and contested) in NDE-related literature.6 In the context of NDEs, cases imply that perceptions occurring during the experience have a basis in objective reality and support the idea that consciousness occurs outside of the body and 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p5.59
the experience have a basis in objective reality and support the idea that consciousness occurs outside of the body and independently of the brain. In past life reports, they assume that a person can remember their past life and appeal to the audience as empiricists, who weigh up the likelihood of two people having the same experience. Both NDE and past-life reports assume that the 6 This case is often repeated as strong evidence for the objective reality of NDE perceptions, even though Maria has never been located and there is no corroborating evidence beyond the report of Clark-Sharp . person 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p5.78
even though Maria has never been located and there is no corroborating evidence beyond the report of Clark-Sharp . person retains their identity across dramatic biological physical changes—including biological death and rebirth. B Psychological Immortality Underpinning case studies of life after death is the fundamental assumption that the ethereal mind continues apart from the physical body, an entity that may remain the same, change radically, or even be shed or otherwise discarded by the spirit at the moment of death. One study found that 58 percent of people reporting near-death experiences felt as if they inhabited a new body at the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p5.96
study found that 58 percent of people reporting near-death experiences felt as if they inhabited a new body at the time of the experience , although oftentimes people report lacking any kind of body during the experience. For instance, Allan Pring recounts that while he was undergoing a surgical procedure, he suddenly found himself in a “different place” where he claimed, “I knew that I no longer had a physical existence. I was not conscious of having a body and the only senses that I was aware of were sight and sound, but even these were very different” . While conducting 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p6.16
only senses that I was aware of were sight and sound, but even these were very different” . While conducting an ethnography of groups in Santa Barbara that provide support to those who claim to have had NDEs, Kinsella found most participants were convinced that NDEs provided solid evidence that, in the words of one interviewee, “we are spiritual beings having a temporary, embodied experience” Overall, the sum of NDE reports reflect the widespread assumption that, as developmental psychologist Paul Bloom states, “we do not feel as if we are our bodies; we feel as if we occupy them” . Bloom’s 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p6.36
states, “we do not feel as if we are our bodies; we feel as if we occupy them” . Bloom’s claim is situated in a growing body of research in the social cognitive sciences, which suggests that ideas about NDEs and past lives conform to intuitive assumptions about the constitution of identity for persons, often referred to as folk-dualism. Research indicates that humans are predisposed to represent persons as composed of multiple “substances”: material bodies and immaterial properties such as minds or “essences” On the one hand, other organisms in our environment are tracked fundamentally as physical, bodily objects; on the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p6.56
or “essences” On the one hand, other organisms in our environment are tracked fundamentally as physical, bodily objects; on the other hand, they are also represented as mindful, psychological beings, guided in their behavior by unobservable mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires, intentions). There is a general scholarly consensus that people everywhere represent themselves and others as being constituted by non-physical properties, hereafter “minds” for convenience The cognitive science of religion has mounted evidence to suggest that these intuitive tendencies concerning the representation of persons also explain some of the cross-culturally recurrent features of supernatural agents, such as gods, ghosts, ancestors, and 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p6.76
representation of persons also explain some of the cross-culturally recurrent features of supernatural agents, such as gods, ghosts, ancestors, and possessed spirits. Although we find many diverse examples of minds without bodies or minds inhabiting other bodies, one constant feature in popular portrayals of supernatural agents is that the individual agent has a mind and, therefore, intentionality 2008; Barrett 1999; Bering 2002; Bloom 2004; Boyer 2001; Cohen and Barrett Likewise, the same intuitions—that people’s minds are represented as retaining their personal identity—may explain why some accounts concerning the veracity of near-death experiences and reincarnation are so widely accepted. Many NDE reports 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p6.97
identity—may explain why some accounts concerning the veracity of near-death experiences and reincarnation are so widely accepted. Many NDE reports include meetings with deceased relatives who retain identifiable characteristics even though they may appear to be considerably different Such evidence of the continuation of personality after physical death is also routinely presented in other kinds of phenomena addressed by parapsychology, such as mediumship, in which the spirits of loved ones presumably make contact with the living and do so while retaining their unique personality traits, adding to the plausibility that the medium has, in fact, successfully made contact with the deceased 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p7.17
their unique personality traits, adding to the plausibility that the medium has, in fact, successfully made contact with the deceased . Such accounts seem to betray a default cognitive operation behind popular survival narratives. They assume not only that memories are the most accurate test of personal continuity after death, but also that the capacity to remember—perhaps more than any other type of mental functioning— somehow survives biological cessation. This observation is in line with current findings in the cognitive science of religion, which indicate that from a young age, we find it easier to represent some biological needs and related 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p7.37
of religion, which indicate that from a young age, we find it easier to represent some biological needs and related psychological states as ceasing after death (e.g., the need to eat: feeling hungry) than non-physically based states, such as remembering One potential cognitive mechanism proposed as being responsible for generating this selective bias in our innate representations of what the dead do and do not routinely experience has been referred to as a simulation constraint. In the context of thinking about what the afterlife is “like,” this refers to the inability to conceive of ourselves as “being” dead and unconscious, because 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p7.58
what the afterlife is “like,” this refers to the inability to conceive of ourselves as “being” dead and unconscious, because we use mental states to simulate all experiences .7 To be clear, this does not mean that you cannot imagine what life would be like after you are dead (e.g., your funeral, your children’s birthdays, etc.), but such a construal requires a first-person perceptive lens through which you envision 7 For other accounts of the cognitive mechanisms proposed, see Bloom and Roazzi, Nyhof, and Johnson . these future events. This imaginative obstacle means that it is easier to represent your dead 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p7.78
Roazzi, Nyhof, and Johnson . these future events. This imaginative obstacle means that it is easier to represent your dead self, and correspondingly, dead others, as continuing to exist mentally—just elsewhere, whether in a different body or a different realm (see One parapsychological example of this hurdle of consciously representing non-consciousness is the common “life review” aspect of NDEs, which involves the feeling of reliving (or witnessing) significant autobiographical events and reflecting meaningfully upon these deeply personal memories that have accumulated over a lifetime. One woman, speaking of her own NDE at age fifteen, states: Suddenly, wooosh I was going up 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p7.99
over a lifetime. One woman, speaking of her own NDE at age fifteen, states: Suddenly, wooosh I was going up through this tunnel … And then the next thing I knew, I was out in this gray misty place … And then this man came towards me—like a misty light-filled-in outline—and he said, “Come with me and I’ll show you your life.” The thing I most remember having pointed out to me was when I was throwing stones at my brothers and sister. I was about 9 or 10, and I was really angry and frustrated … and they were really 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p8.19
and sister. I was about 9 or 10, and I was really angry and frustrated … and they were really upset. [Seeing this] I was ashamed, and then he took me away from that. Sutherland 1995: 148 Memories of having lived before serve as lay verification cues for people around the world, often under very different circumstances. In places where every ancestor is thought to return to the human world, such as some cultures in West Africa, South Asia, and northwestern North America, newborn children are often examined for distinguishing mental recollections that correspond to characteristics of the deceased Ideas about 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p8.4
North America, newborn children are often examined for distinguishing mental recollections that correspond to characteristics of the deceased Ideas about the continuity of memory in reincarnation are also apparent in elaborate rituals in efforts to determine which Lamas have been reborn and who manifests these revered souls presently The most well-known example of such a tradition is the search for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, a formalized ritual that depends crucially upon a candidate child’s ability to distinguish amongst various objects those which belonged to the deceased Dalai Lama, thus inferring that the child remembers the object from his previous 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p8.6
objects those which belonged to the deceased Dalai Lama, thus inferring that the child remembers the object from his previous life and is the Dalai Lama reincarnated . Furthermore, recent research has shown that intuitions about memory serve as robust evidence of reincarnation for many practitioners of New Age spirituality. White, Kelly and Nichols found that New Age spiritual seekers in the U.S. regard the memory of a specific past life event as constituting stronger evidence that the person has lived before than any other potential cue, such as an inexplicable behavior, physical marks or factual information. These intuitions about the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p8.81
before than any other potential cue, such as an inexplicable behavior, physical marks or factual information. These intuitions about the centrality of memory in establishing reincarnation are not simply a product of being enculturated in such a belief system. White (2015a; conducted a series of studies with Jains in Southern India, who believe in reincarnation, and Americans who endorse stereotypical Judeo-Christian views of life after death. Despite major differences in their explicitly stated beliefs, when presented with a suite of memory-based cues, both sets of naive participants reasoned similarly upon being given a hypothetical reincarnation challenge for “matching” fictional living people 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p9.01
cues, both sets of naive participants reasoned similarly upon being given a hypothetical reincarnation challenge for “matching” fictional living people with their deceased counterparts. Specifically, individuals intuitively privileged a shared episodic memory (memory of a specific biographical event) as evidence for reincarnation over various combinations of other types of memory (e.g., procedural) and physical features (e.g., physique). Being in a hypothetical conscious state without memories appears especially difficult to imagine. Indeed, research suggests that people regard memories, and certain kinds of memories in particular, as more likely to remain constant over physical transformations than any other psychological attributes. For example, in 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p9.21
memories in particular, as more likely to remain constant over physical transformations than any other psychological attributes. For example, in a series of experiments by Blok, Newman, and Rips , participants reasoned that personal identity remains intact Jim”) so long as the target’s (Jim’s) memories are preserved. This memory-identity effect panned out even when the individual was described as undergoing dramatic physical changes: from person to robot, robot to microchip, and then microchip inserted into a new robot. Furthermore, when it comes to reasoning about the perpetuity of the self, people tend to give special credence to episodic (or autobiographical) memories, 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p9.4
comes to reasoning about the perpetuity of the self, people tend to give special credence to episodic (or autobiographical) memories, such as remembering having had dinner the previous night . In contrast to semantic memory, which involves general, factual knowledge that cannot be easily countenanced in terms of its acquisition, episodic memory involves autobiographical events that one can recall having personally experienced at a certain place and time Similar to aspects of the self that be derived from our own predictable behaviors (e.g., “I’m usually stubborn”), episodic memories also give shape to one’s core concept of the self. They feature a 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p9.59
behaviors (e.g., “I’m usually stubborn”), episodic memories also give shape to one’s core concept of the self. They feature a self-referential quality of retrieval (i.e., a sense of “mineness”), or the ability to mentally re-experience the event from a first-person perspective. This gives the individual a continued sense of ownership over the memory. Together, these qualities lend themselves to a sort of intuitive model, or default stance, of psychological continuity after death . For example, if one recalls the experience of having died and seeing the surgeons below attempting to resuscitate her physical body, that individual is likely to be convinced 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p9.78
having died and seeing the surgeons below attempting to resuscitate her physical body, that individual is likely to be convinced that it was indeed herself floating above the operating table, not someone else. Thus, for some people, such convincing episodic memories of having lived before or surviving death are the most powerful epistemological evidence of an afterlife, trumping materialist conjectures about the role of the brain in consciousness. If someone recalls having a memory of a personal event, he or she is likely to assume that they were, in fact, “present” at the time of encoding extant memory is the product 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p9.98
is likely to assume that they were, in fact, “present” at the time of encoding extant memory is the product of the self’s first-hand experiences at that point in time). The “seeing is believing” heuristic is hard to override when thinking about the self after death. C Physical Embodiment Parapsychological accounts of life after death reflect the implicit assumption that the same mind can inhabit different bodies (such as a physical and nonphysical one) at different periods of time, or even multiple bodies over a long, continuous period of time. This observation aligns with a major set of findings in the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p10.17
multiple bodies over a long, continuous period of time. This observation aligns with a major set of findings in the cognitive sciences showing that we perceive others as having an immutable personal identity that exists independently of their physical appearance. For example, young children judge a caterpillar that has become a butterfly, or a dog that has changed breed, as “the same individual” so long as their preferences are the same Yet these ideas are also constrained by our everyday social experiences. As previously noted, there are NDE accounts whereby people are met by deceased relatives, all of whom are identifiable 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p10.35
experiences. As previously noted, there are NDE accounts whereby people are met by deceased relatives, all of whom are identifiable even though they may appear quite different than what the experiencer remembers (they just know it’s that person). Presumably, what makes these decedents “recognizable” is that the person’s mind is essentially the same as it was in life. Although the afterlife is typically described as being populated by ethereal spirits (i.e., people without bodies), however, those who have had NDEs often betray their implicit representation of these souls as still possessing a bounded corporeal existence. These departed souls may be packaged 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p10.54
betray their implicit representation of these souls as still possessing a bounded corporeal existence. These departed souls may be packaged in invisible bodies, but they would seem to be embodied nonetheless. Folk depictions of the dead endow them with literal, if altered, body forms. In addition, to exert pressure on objects in the natural environment so that their presence is detectable in the form of a communicative “sign,” as is the case in many parapsychological accounts, souls must occupy physical space and possess attributes (e.g., mass) enabling them to affect other physical forms . While the concept of reincarnation endorsed in 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p10.73
and possess attributes (e.g., mass) enabling them to affect other physical forms . While the concept of reincarnation endorsed in popular survival narratives includes the assumption that the person can be reborn into another, completely different, body, when physical similarities are present between the deceased and the living, this is seen as constituting strong evidence for the phenomenon . Most often, but not exclusively, these marks correspond with wounds that would have been inflicted at the time of death in a previous life. Congenital abnormalities such as missing fingers, rare birthmarks, and skin irregularities such as discoloration, lesions, spots, or moles 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p10.92
previous life. Congenital abnormalities such as missing fingers, rare birthmarks, and skin irregularities such as discoloration, lesions, spots, or moles are said to betray the cause of death or other misfortunes from the individual’s previous life. For example, Stevenson reports the case of a child who was born with a pale, scar-like tissue approximately three centimeters wide and extending around her entire skull. In conjunction with this unusual physical defect, the girl claimed to recall the life of a man who had had major skull surgery shortly before his death. Stevenson viewed such cases of combined past-life memories and physical markings 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p11.1
had had major skull surgery shortly before his death. Stevenson viewed such cases of combined past-life memories and physical markings as the best objective evidence of reincarnation. In fact, he devoted a major tome to these so-called “reincarnation and biology” subtypes in which he meticulously documented over 200 such cases . Just like comparing the details of personal recollections to historical events, physical marks that correspond to those on the deceased (sometimes observable in autopsy photographs) are also taken as verification that some essential aspect of the individual (i.e., the “soul”) has returned to the human world through literal rebirth. Thus, 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p11.28
that some essential aspect of the individual (i.e., the “soul”) has returned to the human world through literal rebirth. Thus, when a person is reborn they are represented as possessing a bounded corporeal existence that shares some form of continuity with the person before death, and thus provides a convenient (and reliable) means of evidence that they are one and the same person. The appeal of using physical similarities as key indicators of a past life can be partly understood in light of inherent cognitive biases concerning our folk knowledge of persons. Such features are convenient, unique, and easy to detect. 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p11.46
light of inherent cognitive biases concerning our folk knowledge of persons. Such features are convenient, unique, and easy to detect. In the natural world, too, we ascribe continued personal identity to individuals based on stable physical traits when appearance or personality is otherwise radically altered such as Alzheimer’s disease or amnesia, traumatic bodily injury, or as the result of dramatic aging over long periods of time Likewise, by comparing physical marks between the living and dead to ascertain the likelihood of reincarnation, whereby some essential and immortal aspect of the individual is envisioned as remaining the same from one life to 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p11.63
reincarnation, whereby some essential and immortal aspect of the individual is envisioned as remaining the same from one life to the next, parapsychologists are employing the same default empirical devices as those used in the everyday social world. Similarly, Cohen found that members of an Afro-Brazilian spirit possession cult tended to attribute blame to the possessed (i.e., living) person, rather than to the possessing spirit. For example, if a person were drunk at a street party and behaved in socially unacceptable ways, even though onlookers said the person was possessed by a spirit who had displaced the individual’s mind, they still 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p11.81
ways, even though onlookers said the person was possessed by a spirit who had displaced the individual’s mind, they still showed contempt towards the inebriate, and that person would often be sanctioned accordingly . Thus, people seem to find it difficult to disentangle physical appearance and personal identity and harbor an intuitive association between these categories. Again, in accepting a person’s claim to have lived before, parapsychologists are likely to revert to the standard cognitive heuristics that they deploy in everyday contexts, even though reincarnation entails, in principle, a transference of the soul to another form. Together, these observations suggest that 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p11.99
contexts, even though reincarnation entails, in principle, a transference of the soul to another form. Together, these observations suggest that one reason popular reports of NDEs and reincarnation are compelling is because they meet cognitively intuitive expectations about what counts as evidence for life after death. Their wide appeal suggests that they are not simply by-products of enculturation or indoctrination into a particular theology. Our position is that existing findings in the cognitive sciences, along with targeted additional research questions, can help scholars to pinpoint which psychological pressures drive the continuation of these popular ideas even in the face of widespread 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p12.19
help scholars to pinpoint which psychological pressures drive the continuation of these popular ideas even in the face of widespread scepticism and a materialist scientific worldview. II Conclusion To explain why survival narratives have become popular in the modern west we thus need to take account of human cognition. This cognitive approach does not supplant or exclude explanations which look towards socio- cultural particulars that may give rise to them, but rather, complements them. It is rather obvious that to provide a compelling account of particular forms of life after death in a specific culture at a point in time, it 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p12.41
a compelling account of particular forms of life after death in a specific culture at a point in time, it is necessary to be concerned with broader socio-cultural factors. For instance, in addition to providing people with a conceptual framework for their inability to cognitively simulate psychological non-existence , past-life reasoning also satisfies present emotional needs, accounting for challenges by appealing to some previously lived and unresolved traumatic event 2006; Meyersburg and McNally 2010; Partridge 2006; Spanos, et al., 1991; Just as explanatory accounts of the popularity of life after death accounts must take heed of the socio-cultural contexts within which 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p12.62
as explanatory accounts of the popularity of life after death accounts must take heed of the socio-cultural contexts within which narratives are embedded, likewise, explanations of dominant cultural accounts must also recognize the importance of panhuman cognitive processes in shaping their success. We must look not only at mechanisms of indoctrination and simplistic notions of existential anxiety, but also at how such ideas articulate with an underlying cognitive system that works in predictable ways. Such ideas tap basic human cognitive processes, including simulation constraints imposed by consciously representing death as non-consciousness. Parapsychology, while ostensibly empirically motivated, may serve similar purposes as 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death:  p12.83
including simulation constraints imposed by consciously representing death as non-consciousness. Parapsychology, while ostensibly empirically motivated, may serve similar purposes as religion in this natural, complementary sense. This is especially true for cognitive scientists of religion, since cognitive science of religion offers a clear conceptual perspective from which to understand the seemingly impenetrable appeal of parapsychology. Belief in parapsychological phenomena (and yet who may not classify themselves as religious or even spiritual) may even be a better—and untapped—resource for ascertaining the role of cognitive mechanisms in this domain of human reasoning.

In Study 1, participants completed a questionnaire containing a pool of 82 items covering nine facets of belief discernible conceptually within the existing research 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p2.01
completed a questionnaire containing a pool of 82 items covering nine facets of belief discernible conceptually within the existing research literature. Scree analysis followed by exploratory factor analysis indicated the existence of four empirically observable factors: belief in supernatural forces; belief in God and destiny; belief in alien visitation, monsters and conspiracies; and belief in consciousness beyond the body. Twenty-four items were selected as measures of these factors. Studies 2, 3 and 4 demonstrated the convergent and divergent validity of the four empirically-derived questionnaire subscales and their internal reliability. Conclusion. The resultant new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) is 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p2.36
four empirically-derived questionnaire subscales and their internal reliability. Conclusion. The resultant new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) is a psychometrically robust measure and comprises a comprehensive framework which can be used to systematically investigate the psychological and social concomitants of such beliefs. Introduction Belief in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena is widespread throughout the world. For example, Moore observed that around three-quarters of the adult American population accept at least one paranormal belief (for example, ghosts, telepathy, precognition, astrology) while Austin reported that 68% of adult British society reported having experienced some kind of supernatural event, including 31% claiming to have 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p2.78
reported that 68% of adult British society reported having experienced some kind of supernatural event, including 31% claiming to have experienced the presence of a ghost. Brotherton, French & Pickering reported moderate levels of conspiracist ideation in their series of studies. Despite the prevalence of belief in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena there is currently no comprehensive and up-to-date measure available for researchers. The studies reported here document the development and validation of a comprehensive and multi-dimensional measure of scientifically unsubstantiated belief to assist research examining the causes and consequences of such belief. The term paranormal is defined as \'a proposition that 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p3.13
to assist research examining the causes and consequences of such belief. The term paranormal is defined as \'a proposition that has not been empirically attested to the standards of the scientific establishment but is generated within the non-scientific community and extensively endorsed by people who might normally be expected by their society to be capable of rational thought and reality testing\' . This definition emphasises the lack of empirical evidence for a belief and so might include those in conspiracy theories and religious belief, though these are not typically regarded as facets of the paranormal. The present series of studies uses 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p3.42
and religious belief, though these are not typically regarded as facets of the paranormal. The present series of studies uses the term `scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena\' as a generic one to encompass a wider field than is commonly understood by the word `paranormal\'. Belief in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena may seem harmless but can have damaging impacts on personal outcomes and on wider society. For example, a tendency to conspiracist thinking is associated with non-compliance with health care for HIV/AIDS , and a withdrawal from cooperation with security measures . Belief in alternative medicine can lead to inappropriate health behaviours , while belief 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p3.72
withdrawal from cooperation with security measures . Belief in alternative medicine can lead to inappropriate health behaviours , while belief in demonic possession can result in violence against individuals perceived to be afflicted ( Generally, belief in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena discourages appreciation of evidence, thereby harming an individual’s ability to assess current threats and concerns, or to evaluate the importance of initiatives such as testing for cancer in at-risk groups . This may be of concern in politicians who take decisions with far-reaching consequences, such as whether to fund renewable energy sources or homeopathy delivered through a national health service. There 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p4.02
with far-reaching consequences, such as whether to fund renewable energy sources or homeopathy delivered through a national health service. There are several questionnaire measures of paranormal belief, the two most used being the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) originally developed by Tobacyk , and the Australian Sheep and Goat Scale (ASGS) of Thalbourne & Delin . Both of these have substantial limitations. and Traditional Paranormal Belief (witchcraft and the devil). Some items are outdated, for example, the statement `witches do exist\' could be argued to be true since people who follow the practice of Wicca call themselves witches. The item 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p4.57
exist\' could be argued to be true since people who follow the practice of Wicca call themselves witches. The item `There is life on other planets\' is now scientifically supported and accepted as the case. The items in the traditional religious belief scale are Judeo-Christian in nature and do not address the full spectrum of traditional religious beliefs commonplace in many countries today. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale is so-named to refer to those who believe in the paranormal as `sheep\' and those who are sceptical as `goats\'. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale contains eighteen items measuring belief and self-rated abilities in, telepathy, 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p5.06
those who are sceptical as `goats\'. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale contains eighteen items measuring belief and self-rated abilities in, telepathy, psychokinesis (movement of objects by the power of the mind), precognition, and post-mortem survival. Its scope, however, does not cover the full range of popular paranormal belief. Other measures are focused on a narrow range of belief: for example, the Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale measures general conspiracist ideation, the tendency to endorse conspiracy theories across a range of domains. Its scope is thus limited to one specific facet of scientifically unsubstantiated belief. None of these existing measures cover the whole range 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p5.34
is thus limited to one specific facet of scientifically unsubstantiated belief. None of these existing measures cover the whole range of common beliefs in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena. The present study aimed to identity the conceptually and empirically discriminable components of scientifically unsubstantiated belief and to create a multi-dimensional questionnaire measuring belief across a wide range of topics of current concern and using items that are well-understood by the general population. In Study 1, participants were presented with 82 questions covering a wide range of beliefs including the seven facets of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and additionally belief in conspiracy theories, 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p5.62
wide range of beliefs including the seven facets of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and additionally belief in conspiracy theories, religion, destiny / fate / karma, and alternative medicine. Subsequent studies reported here investigated the convergent and divergent validity of the relevant subscales of the new questionnaire compared to existing measures. Convergent validity was measured relative to the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale , the Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale , and the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale . Divergent validity was measured by comparison with the Creative Experiences Questionnaire measure of fantasy proneness , the Rational Experiential Inventory measure of thinking styles , 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p5.9
comparison with the Creative Experiences Questionnaire measure of fantasy proneness , the Rational Experiential Inventory measure of thinking styles , and locus of control . In addition, Study 4 examined how mortality awareness, rebelliousness, and self-perceived marginalisation, relate to scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs. Study 1 Participants There were 393 participants recruited via social media. An opportunity sampling method was employed wherein the researchers used their electronic networks to elicit the input of respondents. Undergraduate students were approached via email, as well as individuals in social networks on Facebook and Instagram. 85 to age 18 (`Advanced\' secondary school level), and 234 had university 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p6.3
individuals in social networks on Facebook and Instagram. 85 to age 18 (`Advanced\' secondary school level), and 234 had university or professional qualifications. There were 122 students , 20 were unemployed, 11 self-designated as home-makers, 210 were employed , and 30 described themselves as retired. Household income was less than £5,000 per year for 109 of the participants, over £45,000 for 30 of the participants, with the majority reporting between £11,000 and £30,000. A majority of respondents gave their ethnicity as `white European\', with the remainder spread among other ethnicities . Religious affiliation was varied: 175 specified having no religion, 136 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p6.77
`white European\', with the remainder spread among other ethnicities . Religious affiliation was varied: 175 specified having no religion, 136 self-designated as Christian, 37 were Muslim, and 6 were Buddhist, while 35 gave their religion as `other\'. Thus, the participant sample covered a broad range of demographics. It should be noted that previous research has shown only weak and inconsistent variation in belief according to these factors . Measures The initial pool of 82 items was created following an examination of existing questionnaire measures of paranormal and conspiracist belief and the a-priori consideration of other areas of belief, specifically belief 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p7.16
of existing questionnaire measures of paranormal and conspiracist belief and the a-priori consideration of other areas of belief, specifically belief in the influence of destiny / fate / karma and belief in the efficacy of alternative medicine. We took a deliberately inclusive approach in order to produce a wide-ranging measure, and this included items measuring religious belief. Nine conceptual domains of belief were identified: anomalous mental powers including clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, and psychokinesis, an example of an item being `some people can see events before they happen\'; traditional supernatural belief including good and bad luck, dowsing, and casting spells, an exemplar 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p7.46
can see events before they happen\'; traditional supernatural belief including good and bad luck, dowsing, and casting spells, an exemplar item being `touching wood can bring good luck\'; fate / destiny / karma, e.g., `some events are fated to occur\'; extraordinary life forms including aliens, the Loch Ness monster, and Bigfoot, e.g., `Aliens from other planets have visited Earth\'; the survival hypothesis including reincarnation, ghosts, and astral travel, e.g., `Some part of a person’s consciousness can survive their death\'; future prediction, e.g., `Study of the stars can be used to predict the future for individuals\'; Energy-based therapies, e.g., \'homeopathy is an 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p7.77
e.g., `Study of the stars can be used to predict the future for individuals\'; Energy-based therapies, e.g., \'homeopathy is an effective form of medicine\'; religious beliefs, e.g. \'The world was created by a God\'; and conspiracist beliefs, e.g., \'National governments routinely lie to the general public in order to retain power\'. For each of these nine conceptual domains of belief items were generated so that collectively the item pool comprised of 82 in all. The 82 items were scored on a scale of 1-5, where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree, 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p8.07
scale of 1-5, where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree. Results & Discussion All 82 items were entered into an initial principal components analysis in which each item is treated as if it were a factor with an associated eigen value. These eigen values were then graphically illustrated in the form of a scree plot, as after Cattell . Visual analysis of this scree plot indicates four `jumps\' down to the scree line, which, from previous data sets in which the number of underlying dimensions 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p8.36
indicates four `jumps\' down to the scree line, which, from previous data sets in which the number of underlying dimensions is known, indicates the number of principal components which can be extracted. Therefore, a further principal components analysis was conducted in which the number of factors to be extracted was specified as four. Varimax rotation was also specified to maximise the amount of unique variance accounted for by each factor. The resulting four factors collectively accounted for 48% of the variance in the item correlation matrix. Loadings of each item onto the factors are displayed in Table 1. The factor analysis 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p8.65
in the item correlation matrix. Loadings of each item onto the factors are displayed in Table 1. The factor analysis showed only 11 items of 82 that loaded above 0.4 onto two factors, and no items that loaded above 0.4 onto more than two factors. This fails to offer evidence for a general factor. INSERT TABLE 1 HERE - the lead item being `hanging a mirror in a special place can bring good fortune to a house\' ; belief in the influence of God and destiny (BIGD), the lead item being `God has created rules for correct moral behaviour\' ; belief 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p8.94
influence of God and destiny (BIGD), the lead item being `God has created rules for correct moral behaviour\' ; belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies (BAMC) - the lead item being `There is no physical evidence on earth of alien visitors from other planets\' (reverse scored) ; and, belief in consciousness beyond the body (BCB), the lead item being `Individual existence ends with death\' (reverse scored) . Collectively these four empirically derived subscales constitute the twenty-four item Multidimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB). Their second cluster, traditional paranormal beliefs (witchcraft and the devil), resembles belief in the influence of God 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p9.43
Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB). Their second cluster, traditional paranormal beliefs (witchcraft and the devil), resembles belief in the influence of God and destiny which include items measuring traditional religious belief. Differences are likely to be due to the small number of items in the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale wherein it is not possible to discover some clusters of beliefs given no items addressed all of the relevant areas of belief. For example, Lange et al could not have discovered a cluster resembling the belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies since there were no items accessing conspiracist beliefs in the RPBS. Lange 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p9.98
resembling the belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies since there were no items accessing conspiracist beliefs in the RPBS. Lange et al did not find a distinct cluster of items relating to belief in consciousness existing beyond the body. This may be because the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale did not examine this belief directly; the items in the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale spirituality facet relate to astral travel, reincarnation, and communication with the dead, which may imply, but do not specifically state, the possibility of consciousness existing outside the body. The belief in consciousness beyond the body factor appears more focused 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p10.28
state, the possibility of consciousness existing outside the body. The belief in consciousness beyond the body factor appears more focused than the other factors, but this is what the results indicated so this would appear to be a genuine factor derived from a large sample. . The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale maps conceptually onto both the belief in supernatural forces and belief in consciousness beyond the body scales, though the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale has only a single scale. This is possibly because the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale contains only two items pertinent to the belief in consciousness beyond the body (addressing life after 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p10.57
the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale contains only two items pertinent to the belief in consciousness beyond the body (addressing life after death) and this may be too narrow in scope to be apparent as a distinct factor. Study 2 The aim of Study 2 was to investigate the convergent and discriminant validity of the new MQSUB. Convergent validity would be supported by the observation of substantive correlations between the subscales of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs and existing questionnaires with equivalent or overlapping conceptual content, while divergent validity would be supported by the observation of smaller correlations elsewhere. The 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p10.86
with equivalent or overlapping conceptual content, while divergent validity would be supported by the observation of smaller correlations elsewhere. The following correlations were predicted on the basis of conceptual overlap and similarity of content between the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs and other measures: belief in supernatural forces (BSF) should correlate substantively with almost all facets of the RPBS, since the facets all suppose the existence of forces beyond the natural world; the exception is Traditional Religious belief, which is often characterised somewhat differently to other forms of scientifically unsubstantiated belief; belief in the influence of God and destiny (BIGD) 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p11.16
often characterised somewhat differently to other forms of scientifically unsubstantiated belief; belief in the influence of God and destiny (BIGD) should correlate substantively with the Traditional Religion facet of the RPBS; belief in the influence of God and destiny should also correlate strongly with the Precognition facet, which presupposes the existence of a force, conceptually similar to destiny, controlling future events; belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies (BAMC) should correlate substantively with the Extraordinary Life Forms facet of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and with the GCBS since these purpose to measure the same concepts; and, belief in consciousness beyond the 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p11.48
Belief Scale and with the GCBS since these purpose to measure the same concepts; and, belief in consciousness beyond the body (BCB) should correlate substantively with the Traditional Religion and Spiritualism facets of the RPBS, which depend on some form of soul, or mind that is not tied to the body. Several other predictions for moderately sized correlations were based on previous studies. Correlations among the facets of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale suggest that small to moderate correlations should be expected among all of the scales of the MQSUB. The observation by Darwin, Neave & Holmes of moderate correlations between 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p11.8
expected among all of the scales of the MQSUB. The observation by Darwin, Neave & Holmes of moderate correlations between conspiracy beliefs and the Psi, Witchcraft, Spiritualism and Precognition facets of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale suggests that belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies should correlate moderately with these facets of the RPBS. The CEQ should be moderately correlated with all the subscales of the MQSUB, following observations of correlations between fantasy-proneness and paranormal belief and experience . Finally, the relationship of Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs scores to demographic variables and individual traits should resemble the relationships of 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p12.11
relationship of Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs scores to demographic variables and individual traits should resemble the relationships of conceptually similar scales in previous studies . Method Participants There were 123 participants, a subset of those recruited to study 1. There were 73 women, 49 men, and one individual who gave their gender as androgyne. Their ages ranged from 18 to 86, mean age = 41.9 years, SD = 14.9. Of these, 56 were married, 10 were cohabiting, 43 were single, 10 were divorced, 2 were widowed and 2 were separated.

There were 15 full-time students, 12 unemployed, 6 home-makers, 69 employed, and 21 retired. Household income was less than £5,000 per year for 25 of the participants, over £45,000 for 16 of the participants, and the majority were between £11,000 and £25,000. Nearly all gave their ethnicity as white European with the rest spread among other ethnicities.

Design Participants completed a series of questionnaires online: the new Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs; the RPBS; the GCBS; the Creative Experiences Questionnaire ; and the demographic questions. Measures Traditional Religious Belief (`there is a devil\'); Psi (`some individuals are able to levitate (lift) objects through mental forces\'); Witchcraft (`black magic really exists\'); Superstition (`black cats can bring bad luck\'); Spiritualism (`your mind or soul can leave your body and travel\' i.e. astral projection); 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p13.01
(`black cats can bring bad luck\'); Spiritualism (`your mind or soul can leave your body and travel\' i.e. astral projection); Extraordinary Life Forms (`the Loch Ness monster of Scotland exists\'); and, Precognition (`astrology is a way to accurately predict the future\'). Participants report their agreement with each item on a 7-point scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7(strongly agree). The test-retest reliability of the facets of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale ranged from 0.71 to 0.95 over a four week period . The GCBS is designed to measure the extent to which an individual believes that the public is not 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p13.34
period . The GCBS is designed to measure the extent to which an individual believes that the public is not told the truth about important issues. It includes 15 questions in a single scale, for example `the government is involved in the murder of innocent citizens and/or well-known public figures, and keeps this a secret` and `the spread of certain viruses and/or diseases is the result of the deliberate, concealed efforts of some organisation\'. The internal reliability of the GCBS was very high at 0.93 and the five week test-retest reliability was also high at 0.89 . The Creative Experiences Questionnaire 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p13.67
very high at 0.93 and the five week test-retest reliability was also high at 0.89 . The Creative Experiences Questionnaire contains 25 items measuring fantasy-proneness, example items being `as a child I had my own make believe friend or animal` and `many of my fantasies have a realistic intensity\'. Test-retest reliability over six weeks was reported as 0.95 and internal consistency was satisfactory with Cronbach’s alpha = 0.72 .

The only inclusion criteria were that the participant should be over 18 years old with a good command 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p14
questionnaires online. The only inclusion criteria were that the participant should be over 18 years old with a good command of written English. The following questionnaires were completed, always in this sequence: the new Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs, the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, the Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale, the Creative Experiences Questionnaire, and the demographic questions. The set of questionnaires took around thirty minutes to complete and participants were able to pause the questionnaires and return within seven days. After completion, participants were given debriefing information and invited to contact the researcher if they had any further questions about 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p14.31
After completion, participants were given debriefing information and invited to contact the researcher if they had any further questions about the study. Results and Discussion There were no missing data. There were no cases where a participant had selected the same response option for all (or nearly all) items, and so all were included in the analysis. Total scores for each of the four subscales of the new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs were calculated as the mean of the items on each subscale, with some item scores reversed as indicated in Study 1. Internal reliability of the subscales 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p14.63
the items on each subscale, with some item scores reversed as indicated in Study 1. Internal reliability of the subscales was good: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.91 for BSF, 0.74 for BIGD, 0.81 for BAMC, and 0.91 for BCB. The score on each facet of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale was calculated as the sum of the items on the facet, with items reverse scored as necessary. The total score was calculated for the CEQ and the GCBS as the sum of all items. Bivariate correlations among the variables are shown in Table 2.1. Each scale of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p14.94
all items. Bivariate correlations among the variables are shown in Table 2.1. Each scale of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs correlated more strongly with those measures with which it was predicted to have a substantial correlation than with the other measures . This pattern of results provides support for the convergent and divergent validity of the new questionnaire. INSERT TABLE 2.1 HERE Statistically significant bivariate correlates (with the exception of Revised Paranormal Belief Scale scores) of the four Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscales were entered into four regression analyses wherein in turn each Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p15.2
Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscales were entered into four regression analyses wherein in turn each Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscale was designated as the dependent variable. Age, ethnicity, employment status, and income, had no relationship with any of the subscales of the MQSUB. With belief in supernatural forces as the target variable, the predictors entered in the multiple regression were gender, relationship status coded as single or not, religious affiliation coded as religious or not, and fantasy-proneness. The four predictors together accounted for 29% of the variance in BSF. Only fantasy-proneness, however, was a significant independent predictor, 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p15.45
The four predictors together accounted for 29% of the variance in BSF. Only fantasy-proneness, however, was a significant independent predictor, t=4.79, p<0.001, beta = 0.41. With belief in the influence of God and destiny as the target variable, the predictors were religious affiliation and fantasy-proneness. Together these variables predicted 10% of the variance in the target variable. Religious affiliation was a significant independent predictor, t=2.48, p<0.05, beta = 0.22, and fantasy-proneness was a marginally significant predictor, t=1.90, p<0.07, beta = 0.17. With belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies as the target variable, the predictors fantasy-proneness, relationship status, and religious affiliation together 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p15.69
With belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies as the target variable, the predictors fantasy-proneness, relationship status, and religious affiliation together was a significant independent predictor, t=3.18, p<0.005, beta = 0.27, and so was fantasy-proneness, t=3.38, p<0.005, beta = 0.29. The relationship of all subscales of the questionnaire with fantasy-proneness is consistent with the literature, showing that fantasy-proneness is related to many types of paranormal belief and experience . The relationship of religious affiliation with belief in the influence of God and destiny and belief in consciousness beyond the body is readily understood by the conceptual overlap between these subscales and common 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p15.94
destiny and belief in consciousness beyond the body is readily understood by the conceptual overlap between these subscales and common elements of religious belief. It is, perhaps, surprising that there were no observed gender differences as the literature shows a frequent though weak effect of gender on many aspects of belief. Nevertheless, it should be noted that females scored higher on belief in supernatural forces in the simple bivariate comparison. The absence of gender effects may be due to a general decrease in gender differences in paranormal belief . Alternatively, the frequently observed gender differences in levels of belief may be 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p16.25
decrease in gender differences in paranormal belief . Alternatively, the frequently observed gender differences in levels of belief may be due to the underlying trait of fantasy proneness, rather than gender per se; fantasy proneness was higher in females than in males in the present study, t = 2.18, p<0.05. Other studies reporting gender differences may not have measured fantasy proneness or entered both variables into a multiple regression to predict level of belief. Another potentially surprising result is that belief in the influence of God and destiny does not appear to increase with age, apparently contradicting the generally accepted 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p16.58
belief in the influence of God and destiny does not appear to increase with age, apparently contradicting the generally accepted knowledge that older generations are more religious than younger generations. It is possible that though belief in God may increase with age, belief in concepts associated with destiny deceases , so that there is no overall relationship. The Social Marginality Hypothesis proposed that disadvantaged groups in society might turn to belief in the paranormal as an emotional compensation for feelings of powerlessness or alienation in their lives. This predicts that belief would be higher in the elderly, those not in relationships, 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p16.91
powerlessness or alienation in their lives. This predicts that belief would be higher in the elderly, those not in relationships, the unemployed, those with lower income, those with poorer education, and among minority ethnic groups. The absence of any relationship between the subscales of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs and demographic factors including age, marital status, ethnicity, employment status, and income, argues against the Social Marginality Hypothesis as operationalised by simple demographics measures. A more nuanced view of social marginality therefore was examined in Study 4. In summary, the convergent validity of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p17.2
marginality therefore was examined in Study 4. In summary, the convergent validity of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs is attested to by the strong correlations between the subscales of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs and the scores on existing questionnaires with conceptually similar or overlapping content. Divergent validity is supported by less substantive correlations where there is less conceptual similarity between the scales examined. Study 3 The aim of Study 3 was to continue the investigation of the convergent and discriminant validity of the new MQSUB. Convergent validity would be supported by a substantive correlation between the 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p17.47
the convergent and discriminant validity of the new MQSUB. Convergent validity would be supported by a substantive correlation between the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and the belief in supernatural forces subscale which has overlapping conceptual content, and a moderate correlation with the belief in consciousness beyond the body subscale which has some overlapping content in so far as it assumes the existence of some aspect of soul or mind that can exist outside the body. Divergent validity would be supported by the observation of weaker correlations with the subscales of the Rational-Experiential Inventory . There is a substantial body of research 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p17.75
the observation of weaker correlations with the subscales of the Rational-Experiential Inventory . There is a substantial body of research linking paranormal belief with an experiential/intuitive thinking style . A smaller body of research links paranormal belief with lower levels of rational thinking . Correlations were predicted as follows: belief in supernatural forces should correlate substantively with the ASGS; belief in consciousness beyond the body should correlate moderately with the ASGS; MQSUBs subscales correlate moderately with Rational-Experiential Inventory Experiential thinking; and, small correlations of MQSUBs subscales with Rational-Experiential Inventory Rational thinking. As in Study 2, small to moderate correlations were predicted 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p18.03
small correlations of MQSUBs subscales with Rational-Experiential Inventory Rational thinking. As in Study 2, small to moderate correlations were predicted among all the scales of the MQSUB. Finally, the relationship of Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs scores to demographic variables and individual traits should resemble the relationships of conceptually similar scales in previous studies .

Educationally, 41 were educated to age 16, 44 to age 18, and 83 had university or professional qualifications. There were 60 students, 4 unemployed, 2 home-makers, with the rest spread among other ethnicities. Religious affiliation was varied: 83 had no religion, 55 were Christian, 20 were Muslim, and 10 gave their religion as Hindu, Sikh or “other”.

10 gave their religion as Hindu, Sikh or “other”. Design Participants completed a series of questionnaires online: the new Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs; the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS); the Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI); and the demographic questions. The questionnaires were always completed in this order and the procedure took around thirty minutes. Measures The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale consists of 18 items designed to measure belief in telepathy, psychokinesis, precognition, and life after death. Items include: `I believe in life after death\' and `I believe I am psychic\'. Items are scored 0 = false, 1 = uncertain, or 2 = true. 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p19.12
death\' and `I believe I am psychic\'. Items are scored 0 = false, 1 = uncertain, or 2 = true. The internal consistency was good in the present study, Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92. and intuitive or experiential thinking (e.g., `I like to rely on my intuitive impressions\' and reverse scored `I don’t have a very good sense of intuition\'). Internal consistency was good in the present study; Cronbach’s alpha was 0.9 for the Rationality scale and 0.92 for the Experientiality scale. Procedure Participants were recruited via social media and completed the set of questionnaires online. The only inclusion criteria were that 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p19.56
Procedure Participants were recruited via social media and completed the set of questionnaires online. The only inclusion criteria were that the participant should be over 18 years old with a good command of written English. The following questionnaires were completed, always in this sequence: the new Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs; the ASGS; the REI; and, the demographic questions. The set of questionnaires took around thirty minutes to complete and participants could pause the questionnaires and return within seven days. After completion, participants were given debriefing information and invited to contact the researcher if they had any further questions about 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p20
After completion, participants were given debriefing information and invited to contact the researcher if they had any further questions about the study. Results and Discussion All questions were compulsory so there were no missing data. There were no cases where a participant had selected the same response option for all (or nearly all) items, and so all were included in the analysis. The total scores on each of the four subscales of the new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs were calculated as the mean of the items on the scale, with some items reverse scored as indicated in Study 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p20.29
were calculated as the mean of the items on the scale, with some items reverse scored as indicated in Study 1. Internal reliability of the subscales was good: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88 for BSF, 0.83 for BIGD, 0.71 for BAMC, and 0.86 for BCB. The score on the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale was calculated as the sum of the items. The score on each subscale of the Rational-Experiential Inventory was calculated as the sum of the items on the corresponding subscale, with items reverse scored as appropriate. Means and standard deviations of the scales and facets are shown in Table 3.1. Bivariate 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p20.58
items reverse scored as appropriate. Means and standard deviations of the scales and facets are shown in Table 3.1. Bivariate correlations among the variables are also shown in Table 3.1. INSERT TABLE 3.1 HERE Scores on the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale were correlated strongly with BSF, and moderately with BCB, as predicted. There were also small correlations with belief in the influence of God and destiny and BAMC, which were not specifically predicted but unsurprising given the tendency for correlations among subscales of belief. As predicted, there was a positive correlation between the intuitive scale of the Rational-Experiential Inventory and all subscales 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p20.88
of belief. As predicted, there was a positive correlation between the intuitive scale of the Rational-Experiential Inventory and all subscales of the MQSUB, and a smaller negative correlation that reached statistical significance only for belief in supernatural forces and belief in the influence of God and destiny with the rational scale of the REI. The correlations among the subscales of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs were smaller in Study 3, ranging from 0.06 to 0.48, than in Study 2 where they ranged from 0.37 to 0.56. It is interesting to note that despite the difference in the magnitude of 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p21.12
where they ranged from 0.37 to 0.56. It is interesting to note that despite the difference in the magnitude of the correlations they still followed the same pattern: the largest correlations were belief in supernatural forces with the other three factors and belief in the influence of God and destiny with BCB; followed by the correlation of belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies with BCB; and the smallest correlation was belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies with BIGD. Statistically significant bivariate correlates (with the exception of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores) of the four Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscales 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p21.34
bivariate correlates (with the exception of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores) of the four Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscales were entered into four regression analyses wherein in turn each Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscale was designated as the dependent variable. Age, gender, and educational status had no relationship with any of the subscales of the MQSUB. With belief in supernatural forces as the target variable, the predictors were relationship status (coded as single or not), employment status (coded as working or not), rational thinking, and experiential thinking.

The four predictors together accounted for 18% of the variance in BSF. Employment status was a significant independent predictor, t=2.37, p<0.05, beta = 0.18, as was rational thinking, t=2.79, p<0.01, beta = -0.20, and experiential thinking, t=4.41, p<0.001, beta = 0.32. With belief in the influence of God and destiny as the target variable, the predictors were employment status, ethnicity (coded as white European or other), religious affiliation (coded as yes or 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p21.76
target variable, the predictors were employment status, ethnicity (coded as white European or other), religious affiliation (coded as yes or no), rational thinking and experiential thinking. These five predictors together explained 52% of the variance in BIGD. The variables religious affiliation, ethnicity, rational thinking and experiential thinking were all significant independent predictors of BIGD. Higher scores on belief in the influence of God and destiny were associated with religious affiliation, t=5.37, p<0.001, beta = 0.32, non-white European ethnicity, t=6.59, p<0.001, beta = 0.43, lower scores on rational thinking, t=4.09, p<0.001, beta = -0.32, and higher scores on experiential thinking, t=3.98, p<0.001, 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p21.98

Scores on belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies were significantly bivariately correlated only with experiential thinking, r = 2.37, p<0.05, beta = 0.18, which accounted for only 3% of the variance in BAMC. With belief in consciousness beyond the body as the target variable, the predictors were ethnicity, religious affiliation, and experiential thinking. These three predictors accounted for 15% of the variance in BCB. Participants with religious affiliation had higher scores on belief in consciousness beyond the 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p22.21
for 15% of the variance in BCB. Participants with religious affiliation had higher scores on belief in consciousness beyond the body than those with no religion, t=3.49, p<0.005, beta = 0.27, and belief in consciousness beyond the body was related to experiential thinking, t = 3.25, p<0.005, beta = 0.24. The correlations between the subscales of the MQSUBs, intuitive thinking (positive correlation), and rational thinking (negative correlation), were consistent with previous research . It is unsurprising that having a religious affiliation (compared to no religion) was associated with higher scores on belief in the influence of God and destiny and belief 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p22.44
(compared to no religion) was associated with higher scores on belief in the influence of God and destiny and belief in consciousness beyond the body given the conceptual overlap between these subscales and traditional religious beliefs. The observation of lower levels of belief in the influence of God and destiny in white Europeans compared to other ethnicities is perhaps to be expected given increasing secularisation in the countries of the European Union. The observation of higher scores on the belief in supernatural forces subscale for those participants in employment (or with higher income as these two variables were strongly correlated) compared 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p22.67
supernatural forces subscale for those participants in employment (or with higher income as these two variables were strongly correlated) compared to those not in employment might seem counterintuitive, given the marginalisation hypothesis of Irwin , but it is not without precedent. For example, Rice reported that higher income was associated with greater belief in psychic healing, and Emmons & Sobal noted that the employed generally showed higher levels of paranormal belief than the unemployed . The absence of gender differences is perhaps unexpected in light of the frequent body of research showing consistent, though small, gender differences but it is 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p22.91
is perhaps unexpected in light of the frequent body of research showing consistent, though small, gender differences but it is noted here that other large studies have failed to find gender differences . In conclusion, Study 3 offers further support for the convergent and divergent validity of the MQSUB. Study 4 Study 4 continued the exploration of the convergent and discriminant validity of the new twenty-four item MQSUB. As in Study 3, it is predicted that scores on the Australian Sheep Goat scale will be related substantively to scores on the Supernatural Forces subscale and moderately to those on other subscales. 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p23.18
Goat scale will be related substantively to scores on the Supernatural Forces subscale and moderately to those on other subscales. Additionally, the locus of control subscale `belief in powerful others\' was predicted to relate to belief in supernatural forces, belief in the influence of God and destiny, and belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies. The legacy subscale of the mortality awareness questionnaire was predicted to relate to belief in supernatural forces, the mortality acceptance subscale to a belief in God and destiny, the mortality disengagement to relate negatively to a belief in God and destiny, scores on mortality disempowerment were predicted 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p23.48
destiny, the mortality disengagement to relate negatively to a belief in God and destiny, scores on mortality disempowerment were predicted to be associated with belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies via the link between belief in conspiracies and social anomie. As per Irwin , self-perceived marginalisation was predicted to be related to scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs, though only weakly. A larger correlation should be observed between self-perceived marginalisation and belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies, following consistent observations that social anomie predicts conspiracist thinking. Reactive rebelliousness was predicted to relate to belief in scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in general, and in particular to 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p23.79
conspiracist thinking. Reactive rebelliousness was predicted to relate to belief in scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in general, and in particular to a belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies via the link with a sense of alienation. As in Study 2 and 3, small to moderately sized correlations were predicted among all the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscales. Finally, the relationship of Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs scores to demographic variables and individual traits should resemble the relationships of conceptually similar scales in previous studies .

Procedure The procedure was similar to Studies 2 and 3, with identical inclusion criteria applying. Results and Discussion There were no missing data.

There were no cases where a participant had selected the same response option for all (or nearly all) items, and so all were included in the analysis. All participants were included in the analysis. Given an additional new measure was included in this study, a brief, twelve item, self-report measure of Self-Perceived Marginalisation as devised by the second author, the results of a one-factor principal components analysis of these items is shown in Table 4.1. An initial scree analysis indicated a single factor solution, 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p26.02
principal components analysis of these items is shown in Table 4.1. An initial scree analysis indicated a single factor solution, with 43% variance explained and Cronbach\'s Alpha=0.88, indicating good internal reliability. All twelve items load substantively onto the factor at above 0.5, with the lead item being item 8: I think that I am someone who exists on the margins of society. INSERT TABLE 4.1 HERE Total scores for each of the four subscales of the new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs were calculated as in Study 1. Internal reliability for each subscale was good: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89 for 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p26.3
Unsubstantiated Beliefs were calculated as in Study 1. Internal reliability for each subscale was good: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89 for BSF, 0.88 for BIGD, 0.75 for BAMC, and 0.91 for belief in consciousness beyond the body . The score on the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale was calculated as the sum of the items. Means and standard deviations of the scales and facets are shown in Table 4.2. Bivariate correlations among the variables are also shown in Table 4.2.

Statistically significant bivariate correlates (with the exception of Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores) of the four Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscales were entered into four regression analyses wherein in turn each Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs subscale was designated as the dependent variable. For the belief in supernatural forces subscale, three variables were found to independently predict scores on this component (with adj.

For the belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies factor, no one variable emerged as an independent predictor . For scores on the belief in consciousness beyond the body subscale of the MSQUB, three bivariate correlates emerged as independent predictors ; self-perceived marginalisation , mortality disempowerment awareness and mortality legacy awareness . The pattern of the relative magnitude of correlations among the four factors of the MQSUBs is similar to that in Study 2 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p27.15
of the relative magnitude of correlations among the four factors of the MQSUBs is similar to that in Study 2 and 3, thereby providing replication. Australian Sheep-Goat Scale was substantively correlated with BSF, replicating the findings of Study 3, as predicted from the overlap in terms of the conceptual content of the items. It can be seen that various forms of mortality awareness are independently related with three of the MSQUB subscales, with scores on the belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies subscale, beliefs in aliens, monsters and conspiracies, being the exception. Notably, mortality disengagement is inversely related to beliefs in 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p27.43
conspiracies subscale, beliefs in aliens, monsters and conspiracies, being the exception. Notably, mortality disengagement is inversely related to beliefs in God and destiny, with higher scores on belief in the influence of God and destiny covarying with lower mortality disengagement, thereby suggesting that beliefs in deities and fate is associated with an enhanced ability to not avoid (or engage with) the fact of one\'s eventual demise. In addition, mortality disempowerment was seen to be independently and negatively related to beliefs in consciousness beyond the body. Consistent with this was the finding that self-perceived marginalisation (also about a sense of disempowerment) likewise 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p27.71
consciousness beyond the body. Consistent with this was the finding that self-perceived marginalisation (also about a sense of disempowerment) likewise predicted scores on this form of scientifically unsubstantiated belief, albeit that bivariately such self-perceptions were correlated with all four MSQUB subscale scores. However, mortality disempowerment was negatively related to belief in consciousness beyond the body and marginalisation was positively related to BCB. It is possible that self-perceived marginalisation promotes a need for belief, and then the chosen area of belief satisfies a more specific and focused area of need. Further, mortality acceptance (inversely) and mortality legacy (positively) were both found 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p28
satisfies a more specific and focused area of need. Further, mortality acceptance (inversely) and mortality legacy (positively) were both found to be independently related to belief in supernatural forces (belief in supernatural forces), though in different directions: people who do not have a sense of mortality acceptance are more likely to believe in supernatural forces; whilst those who have a heightened sense of mortality legacy, of wanting to leave something behind after death, are more likely to believe in supernatural forces, Arguably, however, both of these forms of mortality awareness (high legacy and low acceptance) are about a non-acceptance of death; 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p28.28
Arguably, however, both of these forms of mortality awareness (high legacy and low acceptance) are about a non-acceptance of death; covariance with belief in supernatural forces that likewise transcend death is consistent thereby with such an orientation. General Discussion The new Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) consists of four subscales measuring belief in a broad range of phenomena. Beliefs in this area have been assumed to be organised into several factors, but with disagreement about the number of components. This study clarifies the nature and number of the factors by starting from a broad range of conceptual possibilities. The 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p28.57
This study clarifies the nature and number of the factors by starting from a broad range of conceptual possibilities. The first subscale measures belief in supernatural forces (BSF), including traditional superstitions, future prediction, energy healing, ghosts, and telepathy. The second subscale measures belief in the influence of God and destiny (BIGD) including traditional religious concepts (creation, rules for moral behaviour, and life after death) and the inescapable influence of fate or destiny. The third subscale measures belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies (BAMC) with items addressing alien visitation and the Loch Ness monster, and popular conspiracies, for example national governments routinely 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p28.85
conspiracies (BAMC) with items addressing alien visitation and the Loch Ness monster, and popular conspiracies, for example national governments routinely lying to the general public and pharmaceutical companies withholding cures. The fourth and final subscale measures belief that a conscious existence can continue independent of the body (BCB; belief in consciousness beyond the body). The four subscales correlate with each other at small to moderate levels of association, confirming their relative independence and yet at the same time consistent with observations from previous research that belief in distinct types of scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena tend to co-occur. Smaller correlations with existing 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p29.17
observations from previous research that belief in distinct types of scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena tend to co-occur. Smaller correlations with existing measures were observed where a dimension of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs did not have explicitly overlapping content, in line with previous observations of a general tendency to entertain scientifically unsubstantiated belief. There were also small to moderate correlations with other psychological variables to which the dimensions of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs were predicted to be related . The new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs represents an advance on previous questionnaire measures by including an 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p29.51
related . The new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs represents an advance on previous questionnaire measures by including an expanded conceptual repertoire as covered by its four dimensions within a focused and Some of the relationships between the subscales of the Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs and other existing measures are of particular interest. Self-perceived marginalisation in Study 4 was related bivariately to all subscales of the MQSUBs and independently in regression to belief in consciousness beyond the body, thereby supporting the Social Marginalisation Hypothesis of Irwin . This contrasts with the absence of statistically significant multivariate relationships with 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p29.86
thereby supporting the Social Marginalisation Hypothesis of Irwin . This contrasts with the absence of statistically significant multivariate relationships with the demographic proxy indicators of marginalisation such as educational status and household income, and with the absence even of simple bivariate relationships for most of the demographic variables in Study 2 and 3. Such demographic factors however, may not be good indicators of the more subjective aspects of self-perceived marginalisation, whereas the individual’s perception of their status and influence in society would appear to be more pertinent to their individual beliefs. Previous observations of gender differences were not repeated here with 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p30.28
would appear to be more pertinent to their individual beliefs. Previous observations of gender differences were not repeated here with the exception of belief in supernatural forces in Study 2 and Study 4, with this difference disappearing in Study 2 when fantasy-proneness was also used as a predictor. It is possible that in recent times gender differences, which have generally been small, are becoming less pronounced . Another possibility is that gender differences are not based on gender per se but on other, related psychological variables, for example fantasy proneness, which was not routinely included in previous research. Notably in 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p30.75
but on other, related psychological variables, for example fantasy proneness, which was not routinely included in previous research. Notably in Study 4, various aspects of mortality awareness were found to be independent predictors of scores on three of the four MSQUB subscales. This indicates that an awareness of one\'s three score years and ten has bearing psychologically on the degree to which one maintains scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs. Indeed, it is apparent that such beliefs may form part of a defence against such mortality awareness, though it should be noted here that Fafias, Newheiser, Kahane & Toledo have found that cuing mortality 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p31.14
such mortality awareness, though it should be noted here that Fafias, Newheiser, Kahane & Toledo have found that cuing mortality awareness increases belief in forms of rationality as well as irrationality, in particular in a belief in science and scientific reasoning. Therefore, mortality salience appears to have more general effect on beliefs, not confined to the scientifically unsubstantiated. Future research needs to take account of the complexity of the nature of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in order for consistency of findings across studies to emerge. Studies 2, 3, and 4 have illustrated that distinct subscales of belief have different relationships with other 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p31.42
studies to emerge. Studies 2, 3, and 4 have illustrated that distinct subscales of belief have different relationships with other psychological variables. No simple understanding can be reached for relationships between, for example, mortality awareness, marginalisation, rebelliousness, fantasy proneness, thinking style, or conspiracist thinking, and scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs without considering the nature of the belief. Investigations of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs should have sufficient scope in order to ensure that appropriate questions are asked. Too narrow a frame of reference can result in apparent relationships that may not align precisely with underlying psychological constructs. For example, gender differences may be due 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p31.71
result in apparent relationships that may not align precisely with underlying psychological constructs. For example, gender differences may be due to differences in the level of fantasy proneness and not gender per se, and marginalisation as a covariate has not been apparent in the past using simple demographic measures but was evident in Study 4 where questions focused upon self-perceived marginalisation. This underscores the importance of measuring psychological variables appropriately. Fantasy proneness as an individual difference variable was linked in Study 2 with all four subscales of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs to varying degrees. Conceptually, it is feasible to see how the 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p32
2 with all four subscales of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs to varying degrees. Conceptually, it is feasible to see how the ability to lose oneself in an exercise of imagination and to create a fantasy that can be nearly as vivid as the real world might facilitate the maintenance of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs. It would be of interest to investigate longitudinally the psychodynamic functions hypothesis of Irwin to ascertain to what extent childhood insecurity and trauma can lead to fantasy proneness, and thus to scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs. Future research needs to examine how well the factor structure translates across cultures. There may 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p32.27
thus to scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs. Future research needs to examine how well the factor structure translates across cultures. There may be broad agreement regarding the factors, but with some specific items of belief aligning in different relation to the factors. For example, belief in astrology appeared here in the Belief in Supernatural Forces factor in conjunction with belief in superstitions and future prediction, but in other cultures with a different tradition (for example, Hinduism) astrology might be an element of religious belief. Other research could examine whether the relationship between beliefs and other psychological concepts may vary under different religious traditions. 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p32.54
belief. Other research could examine whether the relationship between beliefs and other psychological concepts may vary under different religious traditions. For example, mortality awareness may prompt different kinds of belief in different spiritual contexts. Locus of control may not relate to belief in the same way in collectivistic cultures, where one’s life options are more constrained by societal expectations, and hence locus of control is less internal, as compared with individualistic cultures. Some research has demonstrated that experimentally increasing individual levels of mortality awareness or placing individuals under stress can result in heightened levels of declared belief in the paranormal 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p32.82
levels of mortality awareness or placing individuals under stress can result in heightened levels of declared belief in the paranormal . Future experiments could manipulate mortality awareness or stress to examine the effect on scores on the subscales of scientifically unsubstantiated belief. In conclusion, the new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) offers a concise but conceptually broad ranging measure with good psychometric properties. In the digital age, where information is so readily available and it is easier than ever to acquire beliefs outside of a formal educational setting, a valid and reliable measure of scientifically unsubstantiated belief is useful 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief:  p33.19

present study was designed to assess whether the relationship between narcissistic personality and paranormal belief identified by Tobacyk and Mitchell earlier could be replicated with a general population and to see whether the effect could be found with a narrower definition of paranormal beliefs that focuses only on belief in psychic phenomena. 75 participants completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and two measures of paranormal belief, the Paranormal Belief Scale and the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale. There was no correlation between narcissism and Paranormal Belief Scale scores, but narcissism and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores were significantly positively correlated. Of the three subscales to the Australian Sheep-Goat measure, scores for narcissism correlated with belief in ESP and psychokinesis but not in Life after death. These relationships were interpreted in terms of need for control. 	Narcissism and belief in the paranormal - Abstract:  p0.01
Research into paranormal beliefs and cognitive functioning has expanded considerably since the last review almost 30 years ago, prompting the need for a comprehensive review. The current systematic review aims to identify the reported associations between paranormal beliefs and cognitive functioning, and to assess study quality. Introduction Comparable levels of belief have been documented across various cultures over recent decades [4–7]. The most frequently used scales to measure paranormal beliefs include Tobacyk’s Paranormal Belief Scale in both original (PBS) [8] and revised form (RPBS) [9], and the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS) [10]. Despite widespread use, some concerns exist about both the content and 	Paranormal beliefs and cognitive function: Abstract:  p0
(RPBS) [9], and the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS) [10]. Despite widespread use, some concerns exist about both the content and the factor structures of these measures [11–13]. Nonetheless, both the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale have demonstrated excellent internal reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values around .93 for the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale [14–16], and around .95 for the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale [17, 18]. sciences, medicine, and psychology showing significantly lower paranormal belief scores than those in education, theology, or artistic disciplines [25, 26].

documented in women and younger individuals [27–32], though these sex and age effects are inconsistently reported [33] and have generated substantial debate [34–36]. Paranormal beliefs and cognitive function The association between cognitive functioning and paranormal beliefs has been researched over several decades. Such functions include memory, attention, language, and executive function . As important for cognitive function is an individual’s belief system. Religious and spiritual beliefs have been associated with slower cognitive decline in older adults [38, 39] but have also been shown to have an inverse relationship with memory performance [40] and intelligence [41, 42]. Similarly, so-called “epistemically unwarranted beliefs” [19], which includes belief in conspiracy theories, has been linked with lower educational 	Paranormal beliefs and cognitive function: Abstract:  p0.88
[41, 42]. Similarly, so-called “epistemically unwarranted beliefs” [19], which includes belief in conspiracy theories, has been linked with lower educational attainment and reduced analytical thinking [43, 44]. Conspiracist beliefs are similarly associated with increased illusory pattern perception [45, 46], decreased need for cognition and cognitive reflection [47–49], biases against confirmatory and disconfirmatory evidence [50], and hindsight bias . The last published review to examine the relationships between paranormal beliefs and various aspects of cognition was conducted by Irwin in 1993 [53]. That non-systematic narrative review of 43 studies is now almost 30 years old and may have introduced bias by “…citing null results only when these form a substantial proportion of the available 	Paranormal beliefs and cognitive function: Abstract:  p1.27
old and may have introduced bias by “…citing null results only when these form a substantial proportion of the available data on a given relationship” . At the time of his review, Irwin [53] concluded that, owing to the variable findings, support for the cognitive deficits hypothesis remained uncertain. Research has grown considerably since Irwin’s [53] review and an updated and systematic review is timely. The current review has two key aims: first, to provide the first assessment of study quality [54] in this area and second, to systematically review and summarise key associations between paranormal beliefs and a range of cognitive functions.

magnetic stimulation (TMS) with weak (micro Tesla) complex waveform fields have been claimed to evoke the sensed presence of a sentient being in up to 80% in the general population. These findings have had a questionable neurophysiological foundation as the fields are approximately six orders of magnitude weaker than ordinary TMS fields. Also, no independent replication has been reported. To replicate and extend previous findings, we performed a double-blind experiment , with a sham-field control group. Personality characteristics indicating suggestibility (absorption, signs of abnormal temporal lobe activity, and a “new age”-life-style orientation) were used as predictors. Sensed presence, mystical, and other somatosensory experiences previously reported from the magnetic field stimulation were outcome measures. We found 	Sensed presence and mystical experiences - Abstract:  p0
predictors. Sensed presence, mystical, and other somatosensory experiences previously reported from the magnetic field stimulation were outcome measures. We found no evidence for any effects of the magnetic fields, neither in the entire group, nor in individuals high in suggestibility. Because the personality characteristics significantly predicted outcomes, suggestibility may account for previously reported effects. Our results strongly question the earlier claims of experiential effects of weak magnetic fields. We are grateful to Stanley Koren and Dr. Persinger for generously providing their magnetic field device, and instructing us in its use. We thank Lars-Erik Larsson for technological assistance.

it is difficult to find a natural explanation as to why a surprising coincidence occurs. In attempting to find one, people may be inclined to accept paranormal explanations. The objective of this study was to investigate whether people with a lower threshold for being surprised by coincidences have a greater propensity to become believers compared to those with a higher threshold. Participants were exposed to artificial coincidences, which were formally defined as less or more probable, and were asked to provide remarkability ratings. Paranormal belief was measured by the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale. An analysis of the remarkability ratings revealed a significant interaction effect between Sheep-Goat score and type of coincidence, suggesting that people with lower thresholds of surprise, when experiencing coincidences, harbor higher paranormal belief than those with a higher threshold. The theoretical aspects of these findings were discussed. 	Sensitivity to coincidences and paranormal belief - Abstract:  p0.01
Stone Tape Theory is the speculation that ghosts and hauntings are analogous to tape recordings: that mental impressions during emotional or traumatic events can be projected in the form of energy, "recorded" onto rocks (and other items) and "replayed" under certain conditions. The idea draws inspiration from and shares similarities with views of 19th-century intellectualists and psychic researchers, such as Charles Babbage, Eleonor Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney. Contemporarily, the concept was popularized by a 1972 Christmas ghost story called The Stone Tape, produced by the BBC.[1][2] Following the play\'s popularity, the idea and the term "stone tape" 	Stone Tape Theory - Wikipedia:  p0
story called The Stone Tape, produced by the BBC.[1][2] Following the play\'s popularity, the idea and the term "stone tape" were retrospectively and inaccurately attributed to the British archaeologist turned parapsychologist T. C. Lethbridge, who believed that ghosts were not spirits of the deceased, but were simply non-interactive recordings similar to a movie. History The idea that environmental elements are capable of storing traces of human thoughts or emotions was introduced by multiple 19th-century scholars and philosophers as an attempt to provide natural explanations for supernatural phenomena. In 1837 the polymath Charles Babbage published a work on natural theology called the Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. Babbage speculated that 	Stone Tape Theory - Wikipedia:  p0.13
In 1837 the polymath Charles Babbage published a work on natural theology called the Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. Babbage speculated that spoken words leave permanent impressions in the air, even though they become inaudible after a time. He suggested that it is possible due to transfer of motion between particles.[3] The "Stone tape theory" could also be derived from the concept of "place memory". In the early days of the Society for Psychical Research, place memory was considered an explanation for ghostly apparitions - seemingly connected with certain places. In the late 19th century, two of the SPR-involved investigators, Edmund Gurney and Eleonor Sidgwick, presented views about certain 	Stone Tape Theory - Wikipedia:  p0.27
places. In the late 19th century, two of the SPR-involved investigators, Edmund Gurney and Eleonor Sidgwick, presented views about certain buildings or materials being capable of storing records of past events, which can be later played back by gifted individuals.[3] Another 19th-century idea associated with the "Stone Tape Theory" is psychometry: a belief that it is possible to obtain knowledge about the history associated with an object through physical contact with it.[3] In the 20th century, the idea that objects are able to store and play back past events was re-introduced in 1939 and 1940 by then-SPR president H.

events was re-introduced in 1939 and 1940 by then-SPR president H. H. Price. Price speculated about "psychic ether" as an intermediate medium between spiritual and physical reality, enabling objects to carry memory traces of emotions or experiences from the past. In his works, he stated that the existence of such traces should be proveable by means of scientific methods and yet they remain unproven hypotheses.[3] Following Price\'s ideas, an archeologist turned paranormal researcher, T. C. Lethbridge, claimed that past events can be stored in objects thanks to fields of energy, which he believed to surround streams, forests or mountains. His 1961 book Ghost and Ghoul popularized these 	Stone Tape Theory - Wikipedia:  p0.56
fields of energy, which he believed to surround streams, forests or mountains. His 1961 book Ghost and Ghoul popularized these ideas, which allegedly inspired the creators of the 1972 BBC play The Stone Tape.[3] Reception In their book How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age, authors Theodore Schick and Lewis Vaughn dismissed the idea as an irrational claim, stating, "The problem is that we know of no mechanism that could record such information in a stone or play it back.

According to her, it is an attempt to present a pseudoscientific claim in a seemingly scientific style.[3][4] Hill also suspects that the "kernel of the idea of stone tape" is psychometry,[3] which is criticized for being a form of cold reading rather than an unexplained supernatural phenomenon.[5][6] 	Stone Tape Theory - Wikipedia:  p0.84
Transliminality is ‘‘a hypothesized tendency for psychological material to cross thresholds into or out of consciousness,’’ which has been proposed to derive from hyperconnectivity between temporal-limbic structures and sensory association cortices. Accordingly, it might be expected that transliminality would positively correlate with temporal lobe lability. To test this hypothesis, 135 undergraduate psychology students at an Australian and a British university completed the Revised Transliminality Scale and the Personal Philosophy Inventory , a validated measure of temporal lobe lability. As predicted, scores on transliminality showed a strong association with the general temporal 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1964
a validated measure of temporal lobe lability. As predicted, scores on transliminality showed a strong association with the general temporal lobe scale , as well as moderate correlations with a number of other scalar variables and individual items. The findings are consistent with the idea that transliminality is related to more ungated processing related to temporal lobe functioning, and furthermore that temporal lobe phenomenology promotes transliminal experiences with mystical or religious overtones. # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Personal Philosophy Inventory; Temporal lobe lability 1. Introduction The concept of transliminality was previously described in this journal as ‘‘. . .a hypothesised tendency for psychological material to cross (trans) thresholds (limines) into or out of consciousness’’ . This definition derives from the finding of a single dimension that underlies seven psychological variables: magical ideation, mystical experience, absorption, hyperesthesia, manic experience, dream interpretation, and fantasy proneness. As a result, the phrase ‘‘psychological material’’ is intended to cover a wide range of imagery, ideation, affect and perception. At first this psychological material was thought to flow from the subliminal to the supraliminal consciousness 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1964.69
ideation, affect and perception. At first this psychological material was thought to flow from the subliminal to the supraliminal consciousness , but later research suggested a flow in the opposite direction and even from the external environment to the supraliminal consciousness . Thus, the concept of transliminality as a consciousness variable is a very broad one. Interested readers are referred to Thalbourne for a comprehensive review of the previous research on transliminality, but since that review a good deal of research has been published. Therefore, we review some of this literature next since the progression of the recent studies on transliminality 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1965.03
has been published. Therefore, we review some of this literature next since the progression of the recent studies on transliminality nicely illustrates the rationale for expecting a positive relationship between transliminality and temporal lobe lability. One of the most important pieces of research on the transliminality construct was published in Consciousness and Cognition by Lange, Thalbourne, Houran, and Storm . The 29-item true/ false Transliminality Scale was subjected to a process of ‘‘top-down purification.’’ This procedure involves Rasch scaling , combined with tests for dimensionality , and the removal of biased items in an iterative fashion. In other words, the top-down purification 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1965.18
tests for dimensionality , and the removal of biased items in an iterative fashion. In other words, the top-down purification approach aims to create a reliable and undimensional interval measure of a latent variable that has a known fit to the Rasch model and clearly defined scaling properties . The result is that the original 29-item scale is administered to provide context, but only 17 items are scored and subsequently converted into a Rasch scaled score with a mean of 25 . The following studies are mostly based on this new 17-item Revised Transliminality Scale, which is being increasingly used in 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1965.34
. The following studies are mostly based on this new 17-item Revised Transliminality Scale, which is being increasingly used in research and should be the only scoring scheme used in future work due to its psychometric superiority. The Transliminality Scale shows particularly strong correlations with paranormal belief and paranormal experience variables . Houran and Thalbourne used two scales derived from the work of Kumar and Pekala the ‘‘Encounters’’ subscale, which deals with alleged encounters with beings and entities such as angels, the dead, and UFOs; the ‘‘Poltergeist’’ subscale, whose items deal with general phenomena associated with hauntings and poltergeists; and a 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1965.5
the dead, and UFOs; the ‘‘Poltergeist’’ subscale, whose items deal with general phenomena associated with hauntings and poltergeists; and a single item on apparitions. For a first-year student sample the Revised Transliminality Scale correlated 0.61 with the Encounters subscale, 0.51 with the Poltergeist subscale, and 0.38 with seeing a ghost, all significant at P<0.001. In that article a psychophysiological explanation of transliminality was adumbrated (and modified to a state-trait construct where transliminality is thought to be mediated by intense This initial psychophysiological description of transliminality identified the limbic system as providing source material for phenomena such as apparitional and visionary experiences. This 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1965.66
description of transliminality identified the limbic system as providing source material for phenomena such as apparitional and visionary experiences. This proposal strongly paralleled Persinger’s longstanding hypothesis that experiences of sensed presences, apparitions, and mystical experiences stem from temporal lobe functioning . Thalbourne, Houran, Alias, and Brugger expanded upon the suggestions by Houran and Thalbourne and speculated that a much greater degree of ‘‘interconnectedness’’ or ‘‘fluidity’’ was present in the brains of highly transliminal persons. Specifically, the items that comprised the Revised Transliminality Scale suggested a hyperconnectivity between temporallimbic structures and sensory association cortices. This view predicts that those with theoretically greater 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1965.82
Transliminality Scale suggested a hyperconnectivity between temporallimbic structures and sensory association cortices. This view predicts that those with theoretically greater levels of transliminality will experience perceptual anomalies. For example, synæsthesia has been described as the situation where ‘‘an inducing stimulus produces, at the same time, two kinds of sensory response: the primary sensory experience that is normally associated with that stimulus and, anomalously, a secondary experience in another modality,’’ such as seeing a color in response to a sound . Likewise, Abraham noted that synæsthesia probably reflects heightened connectivity between adjacent cerebral regions. Therefore, synæsthesia is a theoretical consequence of enhanced transliminality. 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1965.98
noted that synæsthesia probably reflects heightened connectivity between adjacent cerebral regions. Therefore, synæsthesia is a theoretical consequence of enhanced transliminality. Thalbourne et al. tested this hypothesis in two correlational studies. The first study involved 115 persons from the Australian general population who had taken part in the study of absorption . Transliminality was here measured by a factor score, and synæsthesia by Tellegen’s seven-item scale. The Spearman rank correlation between scores on transliminality and synæsthesia was a highly significant 0.47. The second study used 242 psychology students who were administered the original Transliminality Scale . The rank order correlation between scores 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1966.13
second study used 242 psychology students who were administered the original Transliminality Scale . The rank order correlation between scores on transliminality and synæsthesia was also a highly significant 0.57. Notwithstanding these results, profound synæsthesia is a rare condition Thus, a collaborative effort is in progress between researchers in Zu¨ rich and the United States in which a sample of extreme, laboratory-validated synæsthetes will be compared to a control group on the Revised Transliminality Scale. There is stronger reason to believe that temporal lobe lability contributes to transliminality. Neppe noted that the temporal lobes, which constitute 40% of the cerebrum, are 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1966.29
that temporal lobe lability contributes to transliminality. Neppe noted that the temporal lobes, which constitute 40% of the cerebrum, are well situated for their major physiologic function of integrating polymodal perceptual inputs of all kinds, including those from the. . .sense organs. For example, smell, balance, hearing, and taste are processed by temporolimbic structures; and vision,. . .touch, position sense, and pain by neighboring areas. In addition the temporal lobes are responsible for interpreting various aspects of affective, conative, and cognitive functions such as memory, learning, language interpretation, and sense of self. . .Thus, complex symptomatology results from firing within a temporal 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1966.45
such as memory, learning, language interpretation, and sense of self. . .Thus, complex symptomatology results from firing within a temporal lobe or non-functional atrophic lesions of parts of a temporal lobe. This may be further complicated by alterations in states of consciousness . If transliminality is an index of the degree of neurological interconnectedness, including more functional connections both within the temporal lobes and with other areas of the brain, then we should expect scores on transliminality to correlate with direct and indirect indicators of temporal lobe symptomatology. Michael Persinger has argued that such temporal lobe symptomatology accounts for a wide 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1966.6
and indirect indicators of temporal lobe symptomatology. Michael Persinger has argued that such temporal lobe symptomatology accounts for a wide range of experiences, most notably of the paranormal and religious and mystical experiences . He devised the Personal Philosophy Inventory to measure a postulated continuum of temporal lobe lability and its putative associated phenomena. As Neppe noted, ‘‘There are already construct validity [data] for Persinger’s temporal lobe scale; normal people who report more subjective experiences similar to those stated by patients whose deep temporal lobes are stimulated surgically show enhanced EEG lability within the temporal lobes but not the occipital lobes .’’ 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1966.76
deep temporal lobes are stimulated surgically show enhanced EEG lability within the temporal lobes but not the occipital lobes .’’ Accordingly, we predict that scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale correlate positively with measures of temporal lobe lability and with aspects of its symptomatology. We administered two measures in counterbalanced order. One instrument was the 29-item truefalse Transliminality Scale revised and scored according to Lange et al.’s Rasch scheme. In this implementation only 17 items are scored, which subsequently constitute a unidimensional scale with good reliability and an interval scale of measurement. The other measure was the Personal Philosophy Inventory . 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1966.92
unidimensional scale with good reliability and an interval scale of measurement. The other measure was the Personal Philosophy Inventory . This Inventory is a true/false instrument containing 140 statements grouped into a large number of (sometimes overlapping) clusters measuring: a control for acquiescence response bias ; the tendency to lie ; paranormal experiences ; general temporal lobe epilepsy ; complex partial epileptic signs ; all signs involving temporal-lobe like factors ; exotic beliefs ; fear ; egocentrism ; rare (psychotic-like) statements ; perseveration ; limbicmotor statements ; automatic behaviours ; intense meaning ; hypergraphia, or writing ; visual imagery ; depersonalisation (4 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1967.12
perseveration ; limbicmotor statements ; automatic behaviours ; intense meaning ; hypergraphia, or writing ; visual imagery ; depersonalisation (4 items); auditory-vestibular experiences ; sense of presence ; suggestibility ; olfactory experiences ; and hypomania . Note that all clusters were divided by the number of statements in them and multiplied by 100 so that the score of each participant could range from 0 to 100. 2.2. Descriptive statistics Table 1 shows the range of scores and the mean and standard deviation for each of the measures. Note that scores on the Rasch Transliminality Scale ranged right across the potential scoring 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1967.37
deviation for each of the measures. Note that scores on the Rasch Transliminality Scale ranged right across the potential scoring range, and have, as expected, a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 5. 2.3. Subjects and procedure Data derived from a convenience sample consisting of 135 undergraduate psychology students . Twenty of the participants came from Adelaide University (Australia) and 115 came from Goldsmiths College (UK). 3. Results 3.1. Correlational data for the clusters Pearson correlations (two-tailed) were calculated between the Revised Transliminality Scale and all of the clusters in the Personal Philosophy Inventory. Seventeen out of the resulting 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1967.62
between the Revised Transliminality Scale and all of the clusters in the Personal Philosophy Inventory. Seventeen out of the resulting 23 correlations were statistically significant and in the predicted direction. Table 2 lists these significant correlations in order of magnitude. We should first note that transliminality correlated significantly though at a low level with acquiescence response bias and therefore an adjustment was made to two of the highest correlations, using the technique of partial correlation. The partial correlation for the correlation between transliminality and the general temporal lobe epilepsy scale decreased minimally from 0.72 to 0.70, while the partial correlation between transliminality 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1967.88
transliminality and the general temporal lobe epilepsy scale decreased minimally from 0.72 to 0.70, while the partial correlation between transliminality and all signs involving temporal lobe factors likewise showed a minor decrease from 0.70 to 0.68. These changes suggest that acquiescence response bias had a negligible effect on the relevant correlations. As predicted, scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale were positively and significantly correlated with the general temporal lobe epilepsy scale, number of complex partial epileptic signs (which is a part of the former), all signs involving temporal lobe factors, sense of presence, liberal (exotic) beliefs, depersonalisation, auditory-vestibular experiences, visual images, 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1968.22
of the former), all signs involving temporal lobe factors, sense of presence, liberal (exotic) beliefs, depersonalisation, auditory-vestibular experiences, visual images, paranormal experiences, hypomania, intense meaning, olfactory experiences, perseveration, hypergraphia, rare (potentially psychotic-like) features, limbic motor processes, acquiescence response bias, and conservative religious beliefs. However, scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale did not significantly correlate with the lie scale, fear or phobia, egocentrism, automatic behaviours or suggestibility. 3.2. Correlational data for the Personal Philosophy Inventory items There are 140 items in the Personal Philosophy Inventory, and in order to ascertain which of them were related to transliminality two-tailed Pearson correlations were computed between 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1968.65
Philosophy Inventory, and in order to ascertain which of them were related to transliminality two-tailed Pearson correlations were computed between the Revised Transliminality Scale and each of the 140 items. Fifty-five correlations were significant at the 0.05 level or less. To control for Type I error, attention was focused on those 28 correlations that were significant at the 0.001 level or better. The wording of the relevant items and their correlation coefficients are given in Table 3. A common theme appears amongst many if not most of the items in Table 3, which we tentatively identify as ‘‘spirituality’’. Even the items 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1969.07
amongst many if not most of the items in Table 3, which we tentatively identify as ‘‘spirituality’’. Even the items concerning physical symptoms might be thought to be a part of the psychophysiological syndrome known in the East as ‘‘kundalini’’, which is another correlate of transliminality . Moreover, it is already known that transliminality is associated with non-sectarian religiosity 4. Discussion The robust pattern of findings clearly supports our hypothesis that transliminality involves aspects of temporal lobe lability. In particular, scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale significantly correlated with 17 clusters and 55 single items from the Personal Philosophy Inventory.

These items arguably reflect a heightened integration among thoughts, emotions, and sensory experience temporal-limbic structures and sensory association cortices)—a ‘‘synæsthetic-like’’ process we hypothesized to underlie transliminality . Given that this proposed hyperconnectivity seems to inherently involve temporal lobe functioning, it is only to be expected that temporal lobe symptomatology would color many of the resulting transliminal experiences. As the primary seat of a rich complex of memory and fantasy, the temporal lobe has been hypothesized to instigate physiological experiences reminiscent of a mystical or religious nature . One persistent observation is the propensity for temporal lobe experiences to 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1970.98
experiences reminiscent of a mystical or religious nature . One persistent observation is the propensity for temporal lobe experiences to be permeated by vague references to death and religious themes; they occur in both nonparanormal and paranormal contexts. Indeed, it has long been known that temporal lobe epileptics are characterized by their obsession with religiosity and morbid themes , particularly if a psychotic element is involved . Accordingly, it is not surprising that 28 out of the 55 single items from the Personal Philosophy Inventory that correlated with scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale concern themes related to ‘‘spirituality.’’ For example, 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1971.18
the Personal Philosophy Inventory that correlated with scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale concern themes related to ‘‘spirituality.’’ For example, highly transliminal individuals in the study tended to have learned to meditate. It would be interesting to know whether high transliminals are prone to taking up meditation, or whether meditation tends to make a person more transliminal by encouraging ‘cognitive kindling’ . The direction of cause and effect is unclear here. Certainly there is evidence that highly transliminal persons are more likely to be introspective , so these findings appear consistent. Transliminal experiences with religious or spiritual themes might be expected to 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1971.38
to be introspective , so these findings appear consistent. Transliminal experiences with religious or spiritual themes might be expected to generally elicit happy or elevated states. However, profound depressive states also seem possible in light of the fact that temporal lobe symptomatology can promote experiences with morbid themes. It was initially thought that a high level of transliminality is a psychologically uncomfortable condition— a distinctive state of consciousness in which the individual is relentlessly bombarded with internal and external stimuli. Because of this, high transliminals might turn to illicit substance use to relieve this negative state . The present results suggest 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind:  p1971.58
of this, high transliminals might turn to illicit substance use to relieve this negative state . The present results suggest an alternative hypothesis. In some cases, it might be neither the amount of psychological material crossing thresholds into or out of consciousness nor poor coping abilities of high transliminals which promote a negative transliminal state. Instead, the degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness of a transliminal experience may be due in part to the themes that accompany the transliminal stimuli via temporal lobe symptomatology—and in this case individual differences are expected .

research has suggested that a number of environmental factors may be associated with a tendency for susceptible individuals to report mildly anomalous sensations typically associated with ‘‘haunted’’ locations, including a sense of presence, feeling dizzy, inexplicable smells, and so on. Factors that may be associated with such sensations include fluctuations in the electromagnetic field (EMF) and the presence of infrasound. A review of such work is presented, followed by the results of the ‘‘Haunt’’ project in which an attempt was made to construct an artificial ‘‘haunted’’ room by systematically varying such 	The Haunt Project:  p0
of the ‘‘Haunt’’ project in which an attempt was made to construct an artificial ‘‘haunted’’ room by systematically varying such environmental factors. Participants were required to spend 50 min in a specially constructed chamber, within which they were exposed to infrasound, complex EMFs, both or neither. They were informed in advance that during this period they might experience anomalous sensations and asked to record on a floor plan their location at the time of occurrence of any such sensations, along with a note of the time of occurrence and a brief description of the sensation.

a note of the time of occurrence and a brief description of the sensation. Upon completing the session in the experimental chamber, they were asked to complete three questionnaires. The first was an EXIT scale asking respondents to indicate whether or not they had experienced particular anomalous sensations. The second was the Australian Sheep–Goat Scale, a widely used measure of belief in and experience of the paranormal. The third was Persinger’s Personal Philosophy Inventory, although only the items that constitute the Temporal Lobe Signs (TLS) Inventory sub-scale were scored.

Temporal Lobe Signs (TLS) Inventory sub-scale were scored. These items deal with psychological experiences typically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy but normally distributed throughout the general population. Although many participants reported anomalous sensations of various kinds, the number reported was unrelated to experimental condition but was related to Temporal Lobe Signs scores. The most parsimonious explanation for our findings is in terms of suggestibility. A recent poll by the Gallup Organization showed that 37% of Americans believed in haunted houses . A previous poll of British adults by MORI showed that 40% believed in ghosts and, of these, 37% claimed to 	The Haunt Project:  p0.79
A previous poll of British adults by MORI showed that 40% believed in ghosts and, of these, 37% claimed to have personally experienced a ghost . Clearly, personal experience plays a large part in producing belief in ghosts and haunted locations, but how are we to explain such experiences? A number of theories have been proposed . People can often come to believe that their house or workplace is haunted following an initial unusual experience that seems to them only to be explicable in paranormal terms. That initial event may be psychological in nature episode of sleep paralysis; see French and 	The Haunt Project:  p1.02
be explicable in paranormal terms. That initial event may be psychological in nature episode of sleep paralysis; see French and Santomauro, or some physical event that defies any obvious explanation when the house was locked and empty). Tandy and Lawrence suggest a number of obscure non-paranormal causes of ostensible ghostly activity including ‘‘water hammer in pipes and radiators (noises), electrical faults (fires, phone calls, video problems), structural faults (draughts, cold spots, damp spots, noises), seismic activity (object movement/destruction, noises) [.] and exotic organic phenomena (rats scratching, beetles ticking)’’. As one might expect, the effects of context and belief in ghosts (and 	The Haunt Project:  p1.11
exotic organic phenomena (rats scratching, beetles ticking)’’. As one might expect, the effects of context and belief in ghosts (and the paranormal in general) all play a part in determining whether or not a particular location will be perceived as being haunted (and by whom). For example, Lange and Houran asked two groups of participants to walk around a disused cinema and to note whether they experienced any cognitive, physiological, emotional, psychic, and spiritual responses in reaction to their surroundings. Half of the participants were simply told that the property was currently being renovated whereas the other half was told that 	The Haunt Project:  p1.19
of the participants were simply told that the property was currently being renovated whereas the other half was told that paranormal activity had been reported there. As predicted, the latter participants reported significantly more physical, emotional, psychic, and spiritual experiences than those in the former group. Wiseman et al. collected data from 678 participants walking around Hampton Court Palace, reported to be one of the most haunted locations in England. Those who believed in ghosts reported more unusual experiences as they walked around than did non-believers and they were also more likely to attribute these experiences to ghostly intervention. It has 	The Haunt Project:  p1.28
walked around than did non-believers and they were also more likely to attribute these experiences to ghostly intervention. It has recently been argued that certain environmental factors associated with particular locations may be directly causing susceptible individuals to experience anomalous sensations. Lange et al. point out that the anomalous sensations typically associated with haunted locations include a diverse range of phenomena from fairly mild experiences, such as perceived sudden changes in temperature, unusual odours, and a sense of presence, up to full-blown apparitions. Such phenomena, it has been suggested, may be induced in some people by exposure to unusual geomagnetic and 	The Haunt Project:  p1.37
full-blown apparitions. Such phenomena, it has been suggested, may be induced in some people by exposure to unusual geomagnetic and electromagnetic fields (EMF) Such unusual fields could have a number of causes including the natural variability in the Earth’s field, movements of tectonic plates against each other, local geological factors such as quartz-based rock and magnetic mineral properties, and man-made electrical devices . The first line of evidence to support this notion comes from a number of studies that have measured the EMFs in reputedly haunted locations. EMFs at any specific location constantly vary both spatially and temporally. Some studies have 	The Haunt Project:  p1.45
the EMFs in reputedly haunted locations. EMFs at any specific location constantly vary both spatially and temporally. Some studies have found that reputedly haunted locations show unusual overall levels in the EMFs present some that the variability and complexity of the field is unusual some that both ambient levels and variability are unusual and a few find no field anomalies at all . Furthermore, Persinger claims that reports of anomalous experiences, including those associated with poltergeist activity tend to occur more often during periods of heightened geomagnetic activity caused by tectonic stresses in the Earth’s crust (but see Rutkowski, 1984, and 	The Haunt Project:  p1.54
often during periods of heightened geomagnetic activity caused by tectonic stresses in the Earth’s crust (but see Rutkowski, 1984, and Wilkinson As pointed out by Braithwaite , one major problem with this approach is the relative lack of time-linked synchronized) recordings at both a reputedly haunted location and a reputedly non-haunted comparison location (see Without such data, it is quite possible that as many magnetic anomalies exist in both types of environment especially given the inconsistency of results reported from the reputedly haunted locations. Furthermore, Braithwaite emphasizes the need for simultaneous recordings from both target and baseline control sites in order 	The Haunt Project:  p1.63
reputedly haunted locations. Furthermore, Braithwaite emphasizes the need for simultaneous recordings from both target and baseline control sites in order to eliminate the possibility that a time-based difference is misinterpreted as a spatial difference. If recordings are not taken simultaneously, it is possible, for example, that anomalous fields were occurring at both sites during the first recording and neither during the second. If the first recording was at the ‘‘haunted’’ site, investigators might erroneously conclude that they have further evidence for the EMF hypothesis. Braithwaite provides evidence from his own study, using simultaneous recordings from haunted and nearby baseline areas, that 	The Haunt Project:  p1.72
the EMF hypothesis. Braithwaite provides evidence from his own study, using simultaneous recordings from haunted and nearby baseline areas, that the magnetic field was indeed unusual at the former whilst simultaneously no unusual fields were recorded at the latter but such studies are rare to date. The idea that field complexity may be more important than overall ambient field strength in inducing such experiences is supported by a further line of evidence, that is, results from laboratory-based studies. Across a series of studies, Persinger and colleagues claimto have induced anomalous experiences, including in one case that of a full-blown apparition , 	The Haunt Project:  p1.8
of studies, Persinger and colleagues claimto have induced anomalous experiences, including in one case that of a full-blown apparition , by exposing the temporal lobes of the brain to transcerebral complex magnetic fields. It is claimed that such effects are particularly likely in participants with labile temporal lobes who will tend to score highly on Makarec and Persinger’s Temporal Lobe Signs (TLS) scale. For example, Cook and Persinger reported that six out of eight participants with high scores on the Temporal Lobe Signs felt a presence upon being exposed to transcerebral complex magnetic fields, whereas none of their eight low-scoring participants 	The Haunt Project:  p1.89
Lobe Signs felt a presence upon being exposed to transcerebral complex magnetic fields, whereas none of their eight low-scoring participants did. The exact mechanism whereby exposure of the temporal lobes to complex magnetic fields could cause anomalous experiences in susceptible individuals is not yet clear. Braithwaite argues that the fact that such effects only seem to occur in the laboratory after prolonged exposure suggests that ‘‘the mechanism of interaction is a subtle one perhaps at the level of psychopharmacological effects between synapses of neurons or increased hyperpolarisation of specific inhibitory neuronal systems.’’ The consequences of such effects might be neuronal disinhibition 	The Haunt Project:  p1.98
synapses of neurons or increased hyperpolarisation of specific inhibitory neuronal systems.’’ The consequences of such effects might be neuronal disinhibition producing altered mental states and hallucinations. Unfortunately, until very recently there had been no attempt by independent investigators to replicate Persinger’s research using transcerebral complex magnetic fields. One such attempt was recently reported. Granqvist et al. carried out a double-blind study , comparing the effects of transcerebral complex magnetic fields with shamfields. They found no evidence that magnetic fields induced sensed presence, mystical, or other somatosensory experiences, but personality measures such as absorption, Temporal Lobe Signs scores, and orientation towards a 	The Haunt Project:  p2.06
presence, mystical, or other somatosensory experiences, but personality measures such as absorption, Temporal Lobe Signs scores, and orientation towards a new-age lifestyle did predict the occurrence of such experiences. They therefore argued that the effects previously reported by Persinger , Persinger and Cameron , Persinger and Koren , Persinger et al. may well be nothing more than the effects of suggestibility manifesting themselves in experiments with inadequate use of doubleblind procedures. Persinger and Koren have robustly rejected such criticism, claiming that their work does make use of adequate double-blind procedures and pointing out what they felt were methodological problems with Granqvist 	The Haunt Project:  p2.14
their work does make use of adequate double-blind procedures and pointing out what they felt were methodological problems with Granqvist et al.’s replication attempt. However, Larsson et al. were not persuaded by the objections put forward and remain convinced that Persinger had indeed failed to ensure proper double-blind methodology. Clearly, further research is urgently needed in this potentially fruitful, if controversial, area. Another suggested cause of anomalous experiences is the presence of infrasound, that is, sounds of such a low frequency that they are outside the audible range for human beings. Tandy and Lawrence produced evidence that a standing wave at 	The Haunt Project:  p2.23
that they are outside the audible range for human beings. Tandy and Lawrence produced evidence that a standing wave at a frequency of 18.9 Hz was present in a factory in which several workers had unusual experiences, including Tandy himself who reported seeing an apparition in his peripheral visual field. In a subsequent investigation, Tandy showed that infrasound at 19 Hz was present in a 14th century cellar beneath the Tourist Information Centre in Coventry. Several visitors to the cellar had previously reported anomalous sensations including a sense of presence and apparitions. Braithwaite and Townsend have argued strongly that the case 	The Haunt Project:  p2.31
previously reported anomalous sensations including a sense of presence and apparitions. Braithwaite and Townsend have argued strongly that the case to date for a specific role for infrasound in inducing haunt-type experiences is weak. Amongst their criticisms, they note that there is a lack of comparison baseline data relating to this hypothesis. It is unclear how often infrasound would be recorded from reputedly non-haunted locations and therefore one is once again faced with the possibility that the hypothesis is based upon the positive-test fallacy. Without data relating to the presence or absence of infrasound at both reputedly haunted and non-haunted locations, 	The Haunt Project:  p2.39
the positive-test fallacy. Without data relating to the presence or absence of infrasound at both reputedly haunted and non-haunted locations, one simply cannot properly assess the validity of this hypothesis. Experimental studies of the effects of directly manipulating the presence or absence of infrasound, as in the current study, offer a powerful alternative approach to test the hypothesis. Braithwaite and Townsend also criticise the neuropsychological mechanism proposed by Tandy and Lawrence to explain the postulated effects of infrasound. Tandy and Lawrence had proposed that the effects may be produced as a direct consequence of infrasound inducing vibration in the human eyeball 	The Haunt Project:  p2.47
had proposed that the effects may be produced as a direct consequence of infrasound inducing vibration in the human eyeball due to resonance. Braithwaite and Townsend present a detailed critique of this argument pointing out, amongst other things, that such vibration would be expected to produce visual distortion across the entire visual field rather than just in peripheral vision and that, furthermore, such vibration would be unlikely to produce complex and sustained hallucinatory experiences. Such visual effects have not been reported in previous investigations of the effects of infrasound. However, the notion that both infrasound and EMF anomalies might contribute to 	The Haunt Project:  p2.55
in previous investigations of the effects of infrasound. However, the notion that both infrasound and EMF anomalies might contribute to explain some haunt-type experiences have gained considerable popularity thanks to widespread dissemination in the media, despite the relative lack of strong supporting evidence, to the extent that the current attempt to investigate the possible effects of these factors experimentally was felt to be justified. The current experiment therefore reports an initial attempt to investigate whether, based upon this previous research and speculation, it would be possible to artificially construct a ‘‘haunted’’ room. Specifically, we wanted to investigate whether exposure to complex 	The Haunt Project:  p2.63
speculation, it would be possible to artificially construct a ‘‘haunted’’ room. Specifically, we wanted to investigate whether exposure to complex EMFs, infrasound, or both in combination would lead participants to experience more anomalous sensations compared to a baseline condition. The artificial room used was completely empty, white, and circular. Informal pilot testing had suggested that dim illumination and a cool temperature would be the most suitable conditions for this study, insofar as they are the conditions typically associated with reputedly haunted locations. Participants were asked to spend 50 min in the room and to record on a floor plan a brief 	The Haunt Project:  p2.72
locations. Participants were asked to spend 50 min in the room and to record on a floor plan a brief description of any anomalous sensations they experienced, where they were when the experience occurred and the time at which it occurred. A version of the EXIT scale , which asks respondents whether specific anomalous sensations have occurred, was also employed in this study. Participants were asked to complete the EXIT scale upon leaving the room. It was hypothesised that a greater number of unusual experiences would be recorded on the floor plan and that higher scores on the EXIT scale would 	The Haunt Project:  p2.8
number of unusual experiences would be recorded on the floor plan and that higher scores on the EXIT scale would be found for those participants exposed to EMF and/or infrasound. Essentially, these two scores were both measuring the number of experiences reported, using open-ended and closed methodologies, respectively. Additionally, it was hypothesised that those scoring high on the Temporal Lobe Signs scale might be particularly susceptible to the effects of EMF. Alternatively, if previously reported effects were due mainly to suggestibility, we might find that the actual condition in which participants were run would not have an effect but those scoring 	The Haunt Project:  p2.88
we might find that the actual condition in which participants were run would not have an effect but those scoring higher on the Temporal Lobe Signs and Australian Sheep– Goat Scales (ASGS) would report more unusual experiences anyway. 2.1.

infrasound and the varying EMF fields were all completely safe and full ethical approval was obtained from the Goldsmiths College Ethics Committee for this project. It was important that participants would not be consciously aware of the presence of infrasound during the experiment proper and so pilot tests were run to determine the level to be used. At high intensities, one can actually feel infrasound even though it cannot be heard. Pilot participants were asked to indicate by means of a button- press at what point they became aware that a stimulus was being played to them on each trial in 	The Haunt Project:  p2.36

Participants were informed that no stimulus would be played to them on half the trials. The trials when a stimulus was played to them consisted of three trials each at the following frequencies: 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25 Hz. It was thus established that no participant was able to perceive infrasound at a level below 75 dB. No such pilot testing was deemed necessary for the 	The Haunt Project:  p2.54

The infrasound waveform used was generated by combining two sine waves at 18.9 and 22.3 Hz (frequencies that correspond to create a more ‘‘complex’’ waveform that had somewhat similar characteristics to that recorded in Coventry. This was amplified and output through a purpose-built cabinet at a level that was determined from prior experimentation to be below the general ability of human beings to perceive consciously.

Measurements indicated that the background noise level in the experimental chamber with all equipment switched off was 50 and 65 dB with the air-conditioning switched on. With infrasound switched on, the noise level was 75 dB. The magnetic field waveform was based upon that used by Persinger et al. .

The combined output level was calibrated so that at its maximum it was under 50,000 nT.

A circular featureless chamber measuring approximately 3 m in diameter and 4 m high was built using white canvas on a slotted axle frame inside a standard row house apartment in North London.

The first was an EXIT scale containing 20 items asking if specific anomalous sensations had been felt and so on). Items were responded to as either ‘‘True’’ or ‘‘False’’ and the total score across the whole scale was recorded.

Granqvist et al. reported that the internal consistency across items was sufficient in their version of the EXIT scale to justify the creation of an average score across items. The unintentional change in response format had very little effect on internal consistency across items in the current study, lowering Cronbach’s alpha very slightly to .68. Therefore, responses were summed across items to give a total EXIT scale score . The second scale administered was the True–False version of the ASGS. 	The Haunt Project:  p3.62
items to give a total EXIT scale score . The second scale administered was the True–False version of the ASGS. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale is designed to measure belief in, and alleged experience of, the paranormal. It consists of 18 items that all relate specifically to the three core concepts of parapsychology: ESP (extrasensory perception), psychokinesis (psychokinesis), and life after death. Example items are ‘‘I believe I have personally exerted psychokinesis on at least one occasion’’ and ‘‘I believe in life after death’’. For all items, the response options are ‘‘True’’, ‘‘?’’ (i.e., don’t know) and ‘‘False’’ resulting in a score 	The Haunt Project:  p3.8
after death’’. For all items, the response options are ‘‘True’’, ‘‘?’’ (i.e., don’t know) and ‘‘False’’ resulting in a score of 2, 1 or 0 points, respectively. Thus, the scale has a theoretical range from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating higher levels of belief and experience. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale has been widely used and has proven reliability and validity Finally, participants completed the 140-item Personal Philosophy Inventory, but only the 30 items constituting the Temporal Lobe Signs scale were scored .

These items relate to psychological experiences typically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, but normally distributed in the general population, such as ‘‘Sometimes an event will occur which has special significance for me only’’ and ‘‘People tell me I ‘blank out’ sometimes when we are talking’’. According to Persinger, high scorers are particularly susceptible to EMF variability. The items are presented with a True–False response format and the number of ‘‘True’’ responses is tallied.

Upon completing 50 min in the room, participants completed the three questionnaires and were fully debriefed. 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive statistics and preliminary analyses As participants were recruited from web sites and via email lists, it was possible that the sample recruited might show markedly higher levels of paranormal belief than the general population. However, the overall mean Australian Sheep-Goat Scale score for the sample was 12.97 which is similar to that found in other studies using the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale in 	The Haunt Project:  p5.01
for the sample was 12.97 which is similar to that found in other studies using the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale in which participants were not recruited in this way . Thus the sample appeared to be reasonably representative of the general population. Note that in all reported analyses, it is recognised that there will always be a naturally occurring background field; ‘‘EMF present’’ refers to the presence of our artificially produced field over and above this naturally occurring background.

Examination of the distribution of scores on the EXIT scale revealed that most participants reported some unusual sensations . Only 6.3% reported none and around 70% reported three or more. However, the distribution was quite positively skewed as was the distribution for the total number of experiences reported on the floor plan.

The hypothesised two-way interaction between EMF and Temporal Lobe Signs scores was examined in the second step by entering cross-products of these two variables. Results of analyses for transformed EXIT scores and transformed total number of experiences are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Both analyses revealed a similar pattern of results. In each case, on both EXIT scale and floor plan, the only significant predictor of the number of unusual experiences reported was the Temporal Lobe Signs score. EMF condition, infrasound condition and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores were not significantly related to 	The Haunt Project:  p5.6
was the Temporal Lobe Signs score. EMF condition, infrasound condition and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores were not significantly related to either measure and neither, crucially, was the hypothesised interaction between EMF condition and Temporal Lobe Signs scores. Many participants in our study who spent 50 min in the experimental room reported anomalous sensations of various sorts. The EXIT scale revealed, for example, that 63 of the participants felt dizzy or odd, 39 felt like they were spinning around, 33 experienced recurrent ideas, 29 felt tingling sensations, 26 felt that they were somewhere else, 25 felt pleasant vibrations through their bodies, 20 	The Haunt Project:  p5.7

for the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scale might be somewhat confusing for some participants because the ‘‘?’’ response option might just as well indicate uncertainty regarding the meaning of an item (e.g., ‘‘What does psychokinesis mean?’’) as uncertainty regarding the ontological status of that particular paranormal claim (e.g., ‘‘I do not know if psychokinesis exists’’). In line with this referee’s suggestion, additional analyses were carried out with the ‘‘?’’ responses recoded as ‘‘0’’. Again, this made no difference to the pattern of effects found. a presence, 9 experienced sadness, 8 remembered images from recent dreams, 8 experienced odd smells, 7 experienced terror, 	The Haunt Project:  p5.9
effects found. a presence, 9 experienced sadness, 8 remembered images from recent dreams, 8 experienced odd smells, 7 experienced terror, and 4 experienced sexual arousal. 3.1.2. Secondary analysis As illustrated in Fig. 1, most of the EMF output was concentrated in one specific quadrant. However, a planned related t-test revealed that no more unusual sensations were experienced in this quadrant than the average for the other three quadrants in those participants exposed to complex EMFs [t ¼ .85, not significant]. 4. Discussion As can be seen from Section 3, many of the participants in this experiment reported experiencing mildly anomalous sensations. 	The Haunt Project:  p6
Discussion As can be seen from Section 3, many of the participants in this experiment reported experiencing mildly anomalous sensations. To this extent, we can indeed claim some success in building a haunted room. It is possible that the experimental set-up used in this study (a quiet, round, cool, dimly lit, featureless white room) may have constituted a form of mild perceptual deprivation that was sufficient to induce a hallucinatory altered state of consciousness in some participants. Although the set-up differed in significant ways from that used in Ganzfeld studies, the work of Wackermann et al. may be of relevance here. 	The Haunt Project:  p6.17
in significant ways from that used in Ganzfeld studies, the work of Wackermann et al. may be of relevance here. Furthermore, some of the auditory experiences reported by our participants may be a consequence of hyperacusis publication). However, the degree to which these anomalous sensations were reported was unrelated to the experimental conditions employed. Given that all participants were informed in advance that they might experience unusual sensations whilst in the chamber (in line with the ethical requirements of informed consent), the most parsimonious explanation of our findings is in terms of suggestibility. Such an explanation is supported by the fact 	The Haunt Project:  p6.34
the most parsimonious explanation of our findings is in terms of suggestibility. Such an explanation is supported by the fact that Temporal Lobe Signs scores, known to correlate with suggestibility , significantly predicted both the total number of anomalous experiences reported on the floor plan and the scores on the EXIT scale. We feel that the data collected cast some light upon the psychology of hauntings. A considerable proportion of the participants reported a number of anomalous sensations in response to a fairly mild suggestion that in our white, round, featureless room they might feel some unusual sensations. Such an explanation 	The Haunt Project:  p6.51
a fairly mild suggestion that in our white, round, featureless room they might feel some unusual sensations. Such an explanation is in line with the observations of Houran and Lange . They asked two volunteers to keep a diary for 30 days of unusual events of the type that are traditionally associated with hauntings and poltergeists in a residence with no prior history of such activity. As expected, the instructions themselves were sufficient for the volunteers to note, with increasing frequency, anomalous or unusual events presumably simply because the volunteers were now primed to notice such phenomena. Our findings also failed 	The Haunt Project:  p6.68
anomalous or unusual events presumably simply because the volunteers were now primed to notice such phenomena. Our findings also failed to provide any support for the postulated link between the presence of infrasound and the experiencing of anomalous sensations. It is possible that such effects may be found under different conditions to those employed in the present study. However, it is worth noting that Braithwaite and Townsend have recently strongly questioned the empirical basis for this alleged association. As previously stated, after examining the evidence put forward in support of the original claim and considering the proposed neurophysiological mechanisms put forward 	The Haunt Project:  p6.85
after examining the evidence put forward in support of the original claim and considering the proposed neurophysiological mechanisms put forward to underlie the effects, Braithwaite and Townsend concluded that the alleged link between anomalous experiences and infrasound had yet to be demonstrated and the current study failed to provide any evidence in favour of this hypothesis. Our results are consistent with the notion that suggestible participants responded to the general context of our experimental set-up in such a way that they experienced and reported more anomalous sensations than less suggestible participants. It is worth noting that although the number of anomalous 	The Haunt Project:  p7.01
experienced and reported more anomalous sensations than less suggestible participants. It is worth noting that although the number of anomalous sensations reported appeared, on the basis of bivariate correlations, to be related to both (transformed) Temporal Lobe Signs and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores, the former appeared to be more strongly related than the latter in this study. The Temporal Lobe Signs scores correlated significantly with both the EXIT scale scores and the total number of experiences recorded on the floor plan, whereas the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores correlated significantly with only one of these measures. Furthermore, the only significant predictor to 	The Haunt Project:  p7.08
whereas the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores correlated significantly with only one of these measures. Furthermore, the only significant predictor to emerge from the multiple regression analyses was the Temporal Lobe Signs scores. It may be that this pattern of results reflects the general context of this experiment. The fact is that participants in the current study were not led to believe that the experimental room might really be haunted; they were simply told that they might experience some unusual sensations. Given the known power of contextual effects, it is quite probable that had the same participants been told to spend time 	The Haunt Project:  p7.16
the known power of contextual effects, it is quite probable that had the same participants been told to spend time in a room that was supposedly really haunted, paranormal belief levels would have had a much stronger relationship with the number of experiences reported. Systematic manipulation of such context effects is likely to be a fruitful area for future research. Previous research in other areas strongly suggests that context does influence the way in which respondents fill in questionnaires. As with many psychological experiments, this project raised several issues relating to the inevitable tension between the desirability for ecological validity on 	The Haunt Project:  p7.23
many psychological experiments, this project raised several issues relating to the inevitable tension between the desirability for ecological validity on the one hand and the need for proper control on the other. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate possible effects of applying infrasound and EMF systematically while participants moved around freely, albeit in a constrained space. Clearly, if we are attempting to understand possible psychological effects that relate to what people sometimes experience in allegedly haunted houses, it is more ecologically valid to allow people to move around in this way rather than, say, have them sitting 	The Haunt Project:  p7.3
it is more ecologically valid to allow people to move around in this way rather than, say, have them sitting still with their eyes closed wearing various magnetic field devices on their heads. On the other hand, one has little control over their chosen movements and therefore one cannot stipulate precisely the actual amount or type of exposure they will receive. In the current study, time spent in each quadrant was not recorded. Future studies should either systematically record such information in order to ensure that all participants receive sufficient exposure to the complex EMF or actually specify the amount of 	The Haunt Project:  p7.37
in order to ensure that all participants receive sufficient exposure to the complex EMF or actually specify the amount of time that participants are to spend in each area of the room. The nature of the field itself can vary infinitely and the participants’ movements through the field will add an extra level of complexity to the field as experienced. In this initial study we chose to base the artificial EMFs upon those used by Persinger, but we fully acknowledge that his experimental set-up differs greatly from ours. Amongst the most obvious differences is that his participants do not wander around 	The Haunt Project:  p7.45
his experimental set-up differs greatly from ours. Amongst the most obvious differences is that his participants do not wander around freely and the weak EMF is applied very close to the scalp. Our decision to administer the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and Temporal Lobe Signs after the participants had spent time in the experimental room along with the EXIT scale may seem a little unusual given that predictor variables and outcome measures are not usually assessed in such close temporal proximity. It was felt in this study, however, that to have administered the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and the Temporal Lobe Signs prior 	The Haunt Project:  p7.52
was felt in this study, however, that to have administered the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and the Temporal Lobe Signs prior to the participants entering the experimental room may have served to prime them with respect to the type of sensations they might experience and the fact that the study was in some way related to the paranormal. Furthermore, given that both scales measure relatively stable trait-like dispositions; the experimental manipulations would be unlikely to have any major impact upon how participants completed these scales. The decision as to whether to administer scales at the beginning or the end of experiments which 	The Haunt Project:  p7.59
completed these scales. The decision as to whether to administer scales at the beginning or the end of experiments which involve participants being exposed to ostensibly paranormal experiences (OPEs) is always a difficult one. If participants complete the scales prior to being exposed to the OPE, their responses on the scale might influence their reports of how they interpreted the OPE. For example, if one had just declared one’s complete disbelief in ESP, one may then be less inclined to accept as real a subsequent demonstration of what appeared to be that very ability (albeit that the demonstration may have been 	The Haunt Project:  p7.67
as real a subsequent demonstration of what appeared to be that very ability (albeit that the demonstration may have been based upon trickery). On the other hand, if one had just witnessed such a demonstration prior to completing the scales at the end of the experiment, the demonstration itself may have an effect upon one’s responses by making one feel more inclined to accept the possibility that ESP might really exist. Some investigators have opted for having half the participants complete paranormal belief scales before the experiment and the other half afterwards, but clearly there is no ideal solution to this 	The Haunt Project:  p7.74
paranormal belief scales before the experiment and the other half afterwards, but clearly there is no ideal solution to this dilemma. Furthermore, it should be noted that given the inevitably quasi-experimental nature of any investigation of the relationship between trait-like dispositions (such as paranormal belief levels) and other variables, no strong conclusions can be drawn regarding the direction of causality involved regardless of when the tests are completed. Participants cannot be randomly allocated to belief levels and conclusions relating to such traits must always be tentatively drawn on the basis of the pattern of correlations revealed as opposed to the drawing 	The Haunt Project:  p7.81
traits must always be tentatively drawn on the basis of the pattern of correlations revealed as opposed to the drawing of strong conclusions regarding the direction of causality. Although the results reported do not support the idea that complex EMFs play a role in inducing anomalous experiences, the limitations of the current experimental set-up must be acknowledged. As stated, the decision to allow participants to wander around freely within the experimental space in the interests of ecological validity meant that the amount of time that they spent in those areas of the room affected by the complex EMF was not under 	The Haunt Project:  p7.88
amount of time that they spent in those areas of the room affected by the complex EMF was not under experimental control. However, there was no evidence that more unusual sensations were reported when participants were in the quadrant most affected by EMF compared to the others. It should also be noted that practical limitations precluded the use of double-blind methodology in this study. Although participants were unaware of the condition to which they had been allocated, the experimenters were aware of the condition. Had we found results supporting the EMF hypothesis, this might have raised questions regarding the validity of 	The Haunt Project:  p7.96
of the condition. Had we found results supporting the EMF hypothesis, this might have raised questions regarding the validity of our findings, but as all experimenters were anticipating positive results, any unintended bias would presumably have favoured the EMF hypothesis. In future studies, however, it would be preferable to employ double-blind methodology. A fruitful line for future research would be to focus more directly upon the possible neuropsychological bases for susceptibility to paranormal belief and the reporting of OPEs. Possible directions would be further investigations of the presumed association between paranormal belief and dopamine, and thus the increased likelihood of perceiving 	The Haunt Project:  p8.06
would be further investigations of the presumed association between paranormal belief and dopamine, and thus the increased likelihood of perceiving salient stimuli in noise . In connection with the findings relating to temporal lobe signs, early suggestions of hippocampal hypersensitivity also merit further exploration . It might be the case that paranormal believers demonstrate an uncritical affirmative response bias to acknowledge the existence of any event, as suggested by the literature on seeing meaning in random noise and Reed, 2005a, 2005b; Brugger et al., 1993; Blackmore, the ‘jump-to-conclusions’ style of reasoning or the increased likelihood of seeing a connection between random 	The Haunt Project:  p8.19
Brugger et al., 1993; Blackmore, the ‘jump-to-conclusions’ style of reasoning or the increased likelihood of seeing a connection between random coincidences . It would be naı¨ve in the extreme to expect that a single neuropsychological basis would be uncovered that explained all aspects of paranormal belief and experience given the complexity of the phenomena themselves, but it is certain that neuropsychology will provide many important insights in this area. Similarly, no one has ever suggested that postulated EMF and infrasound effects, either alone or in combination, would provide a comprehensive explanation for all alleged hauntings, even if cases based on sincere 	The Haunt Project:  p8.32
either alone or in combination, would provide a comprehensive explanation for all alleged hauntings, even if cases based on sincere misinterpretation of naturally occurring phenomena and cases of deliberate hoax are excluded (for examples of such cases, see Baker and Nickell, 1992; Christopher, 1971; Morris, 1977–1978; Randi, 1984– Taking the current findings in the context of previous relevant research, it is clear that factors such as suggestibility, temporal lobe liability, context effects and the role of environmental variables merit further exploration in our attempts to understand this fascinating phenomenon. The case for infrasound inducing haunt-type experiences now appears to be extremely 	The Haunt Project:  p8.45
in our attempts to understand this fascinating phenomenon. The case for infrasound inducing haunt-type experiences now appears to be extremely weak, in light of Braithwaite and Townsend’s powerful critique and the current negative findings. Wefeel, however, that the possibility of EMF-related effects is worthy for further investigation. Although, to date, no independent investigator has replicated the results reported by Persinger , Persinger and Cameron , Persinger and Koren , Persinger et al. using transcerebral complex magnetic fields, evidence from other sources is at least suggestive of the possibility that the EMF hypothesis might yet be verified. The work of Braithwaite , 	The Haunt Project:  p8.59
is at least suggestive of the possibility that the EMF hypothesis might yet be verified. The work of Braithwaite , Braithwaite et al. , Braithwaite and Townsend provides, in our opinion, the most compelling evidence to date although we feel that it is not yet possible to draw a definitive conclusion on this matter. In contrast to infrasound, where the waveform used in the current experiment might reasonably have been expected to induce anomalous experiences if the infrasound hypothesis is correct, EMFs vary with respect to many more parameters. It may simply be that our choice of waveform was not suitable 	The Haunt Project:  p8.72
EMFs vary with respect to many more parameters. It may simply be that our choice of waveform was not suitable for our experimental set-up. In future work, we intend to base the EMF waveforms upon those directly recorded from reputedly haunted locations 2004; Braithwaite et al., 2004; Braithwaite and Townsend, by ‘‘replaying’’ data collected from such a site. We readily acknowledge that ours was a very conservative test of the hypothesis that complex EMFs may induce anomalous experiences in susceptible individuals and feel that further tests of the hypothesis are justified.

United States According to a poll conducted by Gallup, 37% of Americans believe houses can be haunted . There are also hundreds of paranormal research groups and societies in all 50 states who investigate and research paranormal activity. Within the last decade, paranormal activity has become increasingly popular in the media, with numerous television shows that follow paranormal investigators or share personal paranormal experiences . However, interest in the paranormal is not new; people have believed in spirits since biblical times.

not new; people have believed in spirits since biblical times. Many hypotheses have surfaced as to why paranormal activity manifests at a particular location; some locations of which are related to the geology and hydrology of a location. These hypotheses include tectonic strain, stone tape, running water, and magnetic anomaly theories. This research attempts to spatially analyze variables, using the Geographic Information System (GIS), that may promote and increase manifestation of paranormal activity. This research will also use alleged haunted locations to analyze correlations between the locations and individual geological and hydrological features.

to analyze correlations between the locations and individual geological and hydrological features. Results of this study indicate one or more geological or hydrological features are suitable for paranormal activity to manifest. Introduction Paranormal is defined as not scientifically explainable . Given the definition, it is not surprising the academic world recognizes parapsychology as a pseudoscience. One of the main arguments the scientific community disregards paranormal research as a science is because most investigators conduct research in a noncontrolled environmental and the results have yet to be proven as statistically significant . Currently, most paranormal research is conducted by investigating an allegedly 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p0.41
results have yet to be proven as statistically significant . Currently, most paranormal research is conducted by investigating an allegedly “haunted location” and collecting evidence. An unexplainable auditory phenomenon is considered to occur more than a visual phenomenon . Examples of auditory phenomenon include footsteps, knocking, voices, music, and sounds of objects moving, which can be heard first hand, or recorded. Recorded auditory manifestations recorded on magnetic tape which can be heard when the recording is played back later is known as Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) . Other unexplainable events associated with paranormal activity or a “haunting” include, feeling of cold masses 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p0.62
Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) . Other unexplainable events associated with paranormal activity or a “haunting” include, feeling of cold masses or cold breezes, the sense of not being alone, the appearance of lights, phantom smells, and objects moving. It is also suggested animals have a heighten perception of paranormal activity and can become distressed . Manifestations of paranormal activity are more common at night; however, occurrences have been reported during the day . For the purposes of this research, a haunting is defined as a recurrent phenomenon (visual and/or auditory), of alleged paranormal nature associated with a particular location However, it 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p0.84
is defined as a recurrent phenomenon (visual and/or auditory), of alleged paranormal nature associated with a particular location However, it is also suggested haunting type phenomena may be connected to a person or family and may fallow these individuals from one location to another . The paranormal research community has adopted many hypotheses suggesting paranormal activity is influenced by geological features such as faults, magnetism/geomagnetism , limestone, magnetite, and quartz . The tectonic strain theory is one of the most popular hypotheses linking geology to reports of paranormal activity . This hypothesis suggests stress less than what is required to generate 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p1.04
hypotheses linking geology to reports of paranormal activity . This hypothesis suggests stress less than what is required to generate an earthquake, within the Earth’s crust, may result in piezoelectricity in sub-surface rock due to highly localized surface electromagnetic disturbances The Stone Tape theory is popular among paranormal investigators. This theory suggests limestone, quartz and/or magnetite deposits can store information, such as an historical event. When the information is released, a residual haunting can occur A residual haunting occurs when a past event is imprinted on these features at a certain location and is ‘replayed’ in the present Paranormal investigators validate this 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p1.22
event is imprinted on these features at a certain location and is ‘replayed’ in the present Paranormal investigators validate this hypothesis by using the First Law of Thermodynamics , which states, energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be changed from one form to another. Parapsychologists have adopted a similar theory called place memory. It is thought information can be stored by the environment and retrieved through extrasensory perception. It is suggested that for place memory to exist, the living are involved, and emotion is involved in either the creation or retrieval of memory. Little is known about how place 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p1.39
are involved, and emotion is involved in either the creation or retrieval of memory. Little is known about how place memory is stored, however parapsychologists do believe the local geomagnetic field, geological features, and weather may influence the storage and retrieval of place memory . Paranormal investigators also suggest paranormal activity can alter magnetic fields, while others think paranormal activity uses energy from an area with a high magnetic field to manifest; thus, it is hypothesized an area with magnetite deposits can generate residual hauntings . In addition, quartz-based rock and rock containing magnetic minerals can have a significant effect on 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p1.56
can generate residual hauntings . In addition, quartz-based rock and rock containing magnetic minerals can have a significant effect on the spatial distribution of magnetic anomalies Bunton-Stasyshyn, and Davis, 2009; Paranormal research groups favor quartz due to its structure and ability to absorb and amplify energy such as a piezoelectric circuit . It is also hypothesized running water can be used as a source of energy, much like a battery for paranormal activity. In The Other Side: A Paranormal Blog at Rapid City Journal.com, Mark Rowland, the lead investigator for the Black Hills Paranormal Investigations summarized this theory by explaining, “because paranormal 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p1.73
City Journal.com, Mark Rowland, the lead investigator for the Black Hills Paranormal Investigations summarized this theory by explaining, “because paranormal activity is believed to be electrical in nature and water is an electrical conductor, water can conduct paranormal activity” . Furthermore, Rowland suggests because running water produces energy, and paranormal activity requires energy to manifest, it can draw the required energy from running water . The objective of this research is not to prove or disprove whether paranormal manifestations are a result of hallucinations or a real external event, but rather to use current hypotheses to conduct an analysis of locations 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p1.91
result of hallucinations or a real external event, but rather to use current hypotheses to conduct an analysis of locations where these hypotheses suggest paranormal phenomena may occur. In addition, locations investigated by the popular television show Ghost Hunters will be used to analyze correlations between the location they have investigated and the individual geological and hydrological features, as well as the calculated suitability of the location. Methods Relevant Data Esri’s ArcMap and ArcCatalog (version were utilized for data analysis in all steps of this project. Data included U.S. National Atlas Water Features shapefile from Esri 2012 data, shapefiles of faults, 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p2.09
all steps of this project. Data included U.S. National Atlas Water Features shapefile from Esri 2012 data, shapefiles of faults, Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS) and digital geology maps from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). These data are freely available to the public. A point shapefile was created by geocoding locations investigated by Ghost Hunters, a television show detailing paranormal activity. Location data was collected from an episodes list located on Wikipedia. Location data were then either geocoded using a batch geocode service or coordinates were collected from the historical site’s respective Wikipedia page and truth checked. Attribute tables were exported 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p2.29
geocode service or coordinates were collected from the historical site’s respective Wikipedia page and truth checked. Attribute tables were exported to Excel using X Tools pro. Manifestation Suitability Model The manifestation suitability model was developed after a review of similar models. Six parameters where chosen after reviewing paranormal theories. These included the following parameters: faults, streams, rock unit lithologies containing quartz, limestone deposits, locations with large localized deposits of quartz, and locations with large localized abundance of magnetite. First, all 50 U.S. states’ geology, faults, streams, and mineral data as well as tables containing geological unit descriptions were downloaded. Limestone and 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p2.49
U.S. states’ geology, faults, streams, and mineral data as well as tables containing geological unit descriptions were downloaded. Limestone and quartz polygons, streams, and fault lines, and quartz and magnetite points shapefiles were created by merging, querying, and exporting the data to new shapefiles. Next, the geocoded haunted locations table was imported to ArcMap and a point shapefile was created. Once the preliminary data manipulations were completed, the limestone and quartz polygons were converted to raster data . Figure 1. Limestone and quartz raster data. The remaining data, running water, faults, quartz points, and magnetite were converted to raster data by 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p2.69
and quartz raster data. The remaining data, running water, faults, quartz points, and magnetite were converted to raster data by using the spatial analyst tool, Euclidean Distance. All raster data had a cell size of 152.4 meters and all outputs were reclassified so no data equaled zero. The paranormal hypotheses do not directly address the specific proximity to these environmental features required for paranormal activity to manifest, therefore distances used were chosen by a subjective interpretation of the hypotheses. Running water theory suggests distances for paranormal activity to manifest would need to be relatively close to running water, therefore, a distance 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p2.89
theory suggests distances for paranormal activity to manifest would need to be relatively close to running water, therefore, a distance of 304 meters was chosen for this analysis . Figure 2. Sample of running water raster near Denver, created using Euclidean distance tool, a distance of 304 meters was used in this analysis. Tectonic strain theory suggests energy required to influence paranormal activity is localized near fault lines. Rutkowski determined the radius of energy release for a very large earthquake to be about 12 miles to 31 miles. As a result, a distance 8046.72 meters was used for the fault parameter Stone 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p3.13
about 12 miles to 31 miles. As a result, a distance 8046.72 meters was used for the fault parameter Stone tape theory suggests events from the past can be recorded on rocks such as limestone and lithologies containing quartz or areas with a high abundance of magnetite or quartz deposits. Therefore, paranormal activity should only occur in a location where these features are present. However, because the shapefile for high abundances of magnetite or quartz is a point, a larger distance of 804.7 meters was chosen for this analysis . Figure 3. Fault raster created using Euclidean distance tool, a distance 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p3.43
of 804.7 meters was chosen for this analysis . Figure 3. Fault raster created using Euclidean distance tool, a distance of 8046.72 meters was used in this analysis. Figure 4. Magnetite and quartz point raster created using the Euclidean distance tool. Distances of 804.7 meters were used in this analysis. Next, all raster data were reclassified in to equal intervals . The reclassified raster data was then aggregated and summed . Correlation between Haunted Locations and Environmental Criteria To determine if there was a correlation between the haunted locations , environmental criteria and level of suitability, the calculated raster’s values were 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p3.74
there was a correlation between the haunted locations , environmental criteria and level of suitability, the calculated raster’s values were extracted at each haunted point location. Then, fields generated in the attribute table were exported to Excel using X Tools pro. Each haunted location was assigned a number based on the Ghost Hunters analysis and evidence review. Locations deemed haunted were assigned a one while locations that did not show any evidence of paranormal activity were assigned a zero. Locations where the investigation did not produce definitive results were deemed inconclusive and were not used in the correlation. Next, a point biserial 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p5.05
investigation did not produce definitive results were deemed inconclusive and were not used in the correlation. Next, a point biserial correlation was conducted using the new classifications of the haunted locations and suitability values. In addition, each environmental feature also was used in a point biserial correlation. Results/Discussion Predictive Paranormal Modeling The purpose of this research was to spatially analyze variables that may promote and increase the manifestation of paranormal activity to determine the validity of popular paranormal hypotheses and theories. Secondly, it attempted to analyze correlations between alleged haunted locations and predictive suitability in the U.S. as well as individual 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p5.47
Secondly, it attempted to analyze correlations between alleged haunted locations and predictive suitability in the U.S. as well as individual geological and hydrological features. The model returned a total of 1,030,036,346 acres , which is about 5.2% of the continental United States. Results suggest most suitable locations are located in the New England area and along the Appalachian Mountains, the north and south regions of the Rocky Mountains, as well as the west coast (Appendix A). The likelihood of paranormal activity manifesting near many of the environmental criteria (running water and faults) is already high because of the large density of 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p5.88
manifesting near many of the environmental criteria (running water and faults) is already high because of the large density of those features in the United States. Further research is needed in the paranormal field to determine the distance from the environmental criteria paranormal activity can be and still manifest. Correlation between Haunted Locations and Environmental Criteria In Excel, alleged haunted locations were analyzed; each of the criteria was organized in pivot tables. The tables were used to determine if there were any commonalities between the haunted locations and criteria. Results indicate haunted locations were more common within suitable proximity to faults and 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p6.27
commonalities between the haunted locations and criteria. Results indicate haunted locations were more common within suitable proximity to faults and lithology containing quartz . Additionally, haunted locations were least commonly associated with suitable areas of high quartz and magnetite deposits . Table 2 illustrates results partitioned according to reclassifications. Point biserial correlation concluded haunted locations biserial classification and level of suitability were not significantly related r = 0.05, p ≥ 0.05, . Limestone had the highest positive correlation with the haunted location biserial classification; the probability value indicates the correlation was highly significant, r = 0.22, p ≤ 0.01.

The results also suggest a significant correlation between localized areas of quartz deposits and haunted locations, r = -0.15, p ≤ 0.05. The other criteria did not correlate to the haunted location biserial classification nor where they statistically significant. Statistics suggest paranormal theories may have some validity according to this research. As a disclaimer, proactive methods were used to contact paranormal groups for localized data. Many paranormal groups were contacted and asked to share evidence-based haunted location data.

localized data. Many paranormal groups were contacted and asked to share evidence-based haunted location data. Unfortunately, additional data was unable to be obtained from these sources in support of this exploratory research. For this research to succeed, a larger alleged haunted location dataset is needed, as well as data that is more dispersed throughout the county. The Ghost Hunters haunted location data did not achieve either of these. The data is mostly located on the east coast, and only publically known sites were used, as private residence locations were not shared. Another concern with the validity of this research is directly related 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p7.21
were used, as private residence locations were not shared. Another concern with the validity of this research is directly related to the validity of the Ghost Hunters television show. Questions remain if their paranormal activity is real or staged for television scripts and ratings. This was particularly concerning when sites were categorized into “haunted” or “not haunted.” As the seasons of the television show progressed, more and more sites were stated to be haunted. From a research perspective, it should be known the validity of paranormal data may be called into suspect nature, as it is unknown if this could be 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p7.4
known the validity of paranormal data may be called into suspect nature, as it is unknown if this could be the production team staging events or the Ghost Hunters having more publicized active locations to choose from. Consequently, the exploration of output findings based on methods herein may be enhanced with additional data. Conclusion The haunted locations investigated by Ghost Hunters do not have a significant correlation with suitable locations for paranormal activity to manifest, however some of the criteria use in the suitability analysis do suggest a significant correlation with alleged haunted locations. Furthermore, correlation does not represent causation. For 	Using GIS to Analyze Relationships to Explore Paranormal Occurrences in the:  p7.6
in the suitability analysis do suggest a significant correlation with alleged haunted locations. Furthermore, correlation does not represent causation. For this research project to be successful, paranormal theories for causation need to be researched further. In addition, the paranormal research community must be willing to work together and share their findings to utilize spatial analysis. Once better guidelines are established to determine the proximity to environmental features paranormal activity requires to manifest, the results of this type of analysis will provide a greater contribution to both the paranormal and scientific communities.
