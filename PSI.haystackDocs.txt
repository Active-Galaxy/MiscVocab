Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS) is a commonly used measure of belief in the paranormal. The scale contains items that index extrasensory perception (ESP), psychokinesis (PK), and life after death (LAD). Although, research employs the ASGS as both a general (unidimensional) and factorial (multidimensional) measure, few studies have examined the appropriateness of these solutions. Accordingly, the present paper tested the psychometric integrity of the ASGS via two studies. Study 1 assessed ASGS factorial structure using confirmatory factor analysis.

ASGS factorial structure using confirmatory factor analysis. To achieve this, merging of ASGS data from previously published studies and ongoing work created a heterogeneous sample of 1,601 responses. Analysis revealed that a two-factor bifactor model best explained ASGS organization. This comprised a general overarching factor incorporating two subfactors (ESP and PK). Factor loadings and omega reliability supported a unidimensional structure for the most part. Removal of LAD items improved model fit because the factor added unnecessary complexity and undermined scale psychometric integrity. Study 2, using a supplementary composite sample of 320 respondents, assessed the convergent validity of the emergent ASGS 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P0.22
psychometric integrity. Study 2, using a supplementary composite sample of 320 respondents, assessed the convergent validity of the emergent ASGS model against a recently published Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) bifactor solution. Comparison revealed high convergent validity. The general ASGS factor, despite deriving from only psi-related dimensions (ESP and PK) predicted RPBS scores. This finding indicated that ASGS brevity relative to the RPBS is advantageous when assessing general belief in the paranormal. The ASGS, notwithstanding limited construct content, functions as an effective measure of paranormal belief.

Additionally, Study 2 replicated the bifactor structure identified in Study 1 and invariance testing supported invariance of form, factor loadings and item intercepts for this solution across Studies 1 and 2. Keywords: belief in the paranormal, Australian Sheep-Goat Scale, Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, bifactor model, convergent validity INTRODUCTION Within parapsychology, the term sheep-goat denotes believers (sheep) and disbelievers (goats) The nomenclature originated from Gertrude Schmeidler who observed that increased performance within ESP experiments was associated with the belief that ESP was possible within that particular setting.

with the belief that ESP was possible within that particular setting. ESP in this context referred to “the non-inferential acquisition of information relating to stimuli which is inexplicable in terms of ‘orthodox’ Since Schmeidler’s exact use of the sheep-goat designation, the term has broadened to include belief in the possibility of ESP, experiencing ESP and acceptance of psychic phenomena generally [psychokinesis (PK) and life after death (LAD)]. More generally, researchers employ the label ubiquitously to signify the presence or absence of belief in the paranormal noted this generalization arose from a widening of the notion of the paranormal to include 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P0.95
of belief in the paranormal noted this generalization arose from a widening of the notion of the paranormal to include a broad spectrum of supernatural phenomena. Originally, the descriptor ‘paranormal’ served merely as a synonym for psychic. Generic usage of the sheep-goat distinction, in part, evolved from a lack of conceptual agreement about the nature and structure of the paranormal. Hence, although measurement instruments adhere to common guidelines, such as Broad’s Basic Limiting Principles causation, no action at a distance, or perception of physical events/objects unmediated by sensations) content across scales varies significantly. For example, the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P1.09
perception of physical events/objects unmediated by sensations) content across scales varies significantly. For example, the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) characterizes the paranormal as a multidimensional construct comprising several item clusters (traditional religious belief, psi, witchcraft, superstition, spiritualism, extraordinary life forms and precognition). Contemporary psychometric assessment of the RPBS recommends a bifactor structure comprising a single overarching construct, encompassing several related, but The presence of topics outside of core parapsychology within measurement instruments reflects the stretching and blurring of paranormal boundaries Illustratively, the Paranormal Short Inventory contains questions about unidentified flying objects.

Furthermore, scales frequently include items indexing belief in fringe subject matter, such as new age treatments acupuncture) Although, these topics share thematic features with the paranormal, notably unusualness and lack of a genuine evidential basis, they are not strictly supernatural because they challenge rather than necessitate change within current scientific thinking. Acknowledging these conceptual issues, Thalbourne and Delin recommended restriction of the sheep-goat distinction to core parapsychological phenomena. This focus informed the content and development of sheep-goat measures. Over the years, various scales have assessed the sheep-goat variable. These 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P1.31
focus informed the content and development of sheep-goat measures. Over the years, various scales have assessed the sheep-goat variable. These have differed in terms of factors and item numbers (i.e., single vs. multiple items) Notable examples are the Icelandic Sheep-Goat scales. The Icelandic version contains questions about belief in general extrasensory perception (ESP) [“do you believe that the existence of telepathy (thought-transference) or clairvoyance”], precognition (“do you believe that the ability to know the future or to have dreams about it is”) and frequency of reading about psychic phenomena (“do you read books or articles on psychic phenomena”). Higher scores 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P1.42
it is”) and frequency of reading about psychic phenomena (“do you read books or articles on psychic phenomena”). Higher scores indicate stronger belief in ESP. The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS) began as a list of questions assessing endorsement of ESP (belief in/experience) and LAD (the possibility of contact with the deceased) within participants taking part Subsequent item analysis produced a 10-item measure, which provided support for the sheep-goat dichotomy via correlation with experimental Further ESP-related work supported the scale’s predictive power Although, some studies observed no significant relationship between belief and performance As researchers became increasingly aware of potential psychological 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P1.53
power Although, some studies observed no significant relationship between belief and performance As researchers became increasingly aware of potential psychological differences between believers and non-believers the need for general measures of paranormal belief increased. For instance, researchers observed effects for locus of control dream personality Accordingly, the Paranormal Belief Scale emerged as prevalently used measures. In 1983, the ASGS added additional ESP items assessing belief in the possibility of precognition, sender-initiated and Beyond increasing construct breadth, the 13-item version demonstrated no additional psychometric benefits; the scale correlated highly The modified ASGS featured in several published studies In 1985, the scale appended 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P1.64

Comparisons across ASGS versions revealed high correlations. Psychometric evaluation of the 18-item ASGS specified the measure was a satisfactory measure of belief in and experience of core psychic phenomena. The scale demonstrated good reliability (internal and test–retest) and concurrent validity Exploratory factor analysis, using principal components analysis, confirmed that the ASGS contained three factors ESP, This built on previous analysis, which supported the notion that the ASGS was multidimensional Along with 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P1.75

“strongly agree” advocated use of the Likert scale format because he was critical of the visual analog response style. The visual analog format, asks respondents to record level of item agreement on a horizontal line anchored by goat and sheep belief. The horizontal line is 44 units long (one unit = one-eighth if an inch). Scores on each item are obtained using a rule and range from 1 to 44; recoded as 1–10 = 0, 11–30 = 1, and 31–44 = 2.

This scoring system approximates the false, uncertain and true A subsequent ASGS adaptation by Lange and Thalbourne purified the scale. This involved Rasch scaling, which identified New Age-related and Traditional Belief items (LAD). Removal of the LAD items to correct for bias reduced the ASGS to 16-items. The advantage of Rasch scaling is that it produces interval-level scores, which are independent of gender and age bias. Despite these psychometric developments, the majority of studies continue to use 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P2.07
scores, which are independent of gender and age bias. Despite these psychometric developments, the majority of studies continue to use the original 18-item measure and fail to apply Rasch scaling. Failure to apply Rasch scaling is problematic because the that form the LAD factor are not productive to measurement and may compromise the validity of At a factorial level, Rasch scaling indicates that the LAD subscale does not function as a reliable measurement tool. Indeed, removal of the LAD factor produces a single factor New Age Belief solution This issue potentially compromises analysis at the factorial level, especially in studies, which 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P2.17

Hence, original 18-item scale remains an internally reliable measure of belief in the paranormal. The 18-item ASGS across response formats has typically to excellent Illustratively, Thalbourne and reported a Cronbach alpha (a) of 0.94 for the an alpha of 0.92 for the forced-choice version.

Accordingly, the present paper examined whether the ASGS functioned best as a multidimensional or general measure. Relative to the RPBS, few studies use ASGS subscales to assess variations in belief.

approach by including multidimensionality vs. unidimensionality within a single analysis. Explicitly, bifactor modeling assessed ASGS dimensionality and factorial solution adequacy. This analysis was vital to defining the boundaries of ASGS use. In this context, previous work has failed to delineate adequately the dimensionality of the ASGS. Noting the established use of the ASGS within the parapsychological and psychological literature and the fact that researchers report both unidimensional and factorial scores, this paper undertook two studies examining the measure’s psychometric integrity. Study 1 tested ASGS factorial structure, and Study 2, evaluated measurement invariance of the ASGS and its performance in relation 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P2.57

STUDY 1: FACTORIAL STRUCTURE OF THE AUSTRALIAN SHEEP-GOAT SCALE Within published work researchers have used the ASGS as and multidimensional measure (ESP, PK, and LAD) Although it is rare to use ASGS subscales, there are clear advantages to the inclusion of factorial comparisons. Specifically, although ESP and PK collectively represent forms of psi, the degree to which people endorse the phenomena varies.

usefully delimited the most appropriate scoring system for the RPBS and reaffirmed the veracity of research using general and seven-factor solutions. Accordingly, Study 1 examined whether it was valid for researchers to use both unidimensional and factorial ASGS solutions. As with the RPBS paper, the intention was to delineate appropriate scale scoring. Method Respondents Merging of ASGS data sets from published studies and continuing work produced a large heterogeneous sample . Several researchers have previously employed this approach to assess scale structure and integrity.

Notably, top-down and Need for Merging of ASGS data sets was appropriate because the researchers had previously used the measure in comparable studies addressing different research questions. Combining these data made it possible to examine the psychometric structure of the ASGS using sophisticated statistical techniques. Large data sets facilitate the performance of complex analytical methods by virtue of enhanced statistical power and greater within sample For these reasons, Brown advocates that confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) should use as many cases as possible.

More generally, integration of small data sets avoids research costs associated with study design, recruitment and data collection, and produces a sample that would typical prove difficult to recruit because of time and cost constraints. The mean (M) sample age was 27.01 years Disaggregation by gender revealed that 547 and 1054 Data collection occurred between September 2012 and September 2016 (see “Ethics” section).

Recruitment was by emails to students (undergraduate and postgraduate) enrolled on healthcare programs Physiotherapy, Psychology, Speech and Language Therapy, etc.), staff across faculties at a United Kingdom university, and local businesses/community groups. There were two exclusion criteria. Firstly, respondents had to be at least 18 years of age. Secondly, in order to prevent multiple responses instructions stated that respondents must not participate if they had undertaken similar research.

All studies used the same basic standardized procedures. Prior to participation, the researchers presented prospective respondents with comprehensive background information. This contained the purpose of the study and outlined ethical procedures. Respondents agreeing to participate recorded informed consent by selecting an option confirming their willingness to take part.

Respondents also provided basic demographic information (age, preferred gender, course of study if student, etc.). Procedural instructions directed respondents to work through the sections systematically at their own pace, to answer all questions in an open and honest manner, and reassured respondents that there were no right or wrong answers. Section order rotated across respondents to prevent potential order effects.

Firstly, a one-factor model, which acted as a baseline comparison for later solutions. Next, a correlated three-factor model based on Thalbourne and examined whether ESP, PK, and LAD subfactors most effectively represented the ASGS.

A correlated two-factor variant of this condensed 16-item version of the scale tested goodness of fit, with the identification of subfactors consistent (i.e., ESP and PK, but not LAD). Lastly, a bifactor version of this solution assessed data-model fit. A range of indices determined goodness of fit.

Compared with the three-factor bifactor model, the two-factor bifactor solution possessed marginally superior data-model fit. This therefore was the most appropriate factorial conceptualization of the ASGS. An inspection of factor loadings for the two-factor bifactor model 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P4.65
therefore was the most appropriate factorial conceptualization of the ASGS. An inspection of factor loadings for the two-factor bifactor model revealed that all items loaded above the minimum cutoff on the general ASGS factor. In comparison, items 3, 4, 2, and 13 did not significantly load on the ESP subfactor, indicating that these items more directly predicted a general factor. In addition, negative loadings were evident for some ESP items, which can unexpectedly occur in bifactor models as a function of a crossover suppression effect . The average factor loadings were 0.56 on PK, 0.03 on ESP, and 0.58 on 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P4.76
of a crossover suppression effect . The average factor loadings were 0.56 on PK, 0.03 on ESP, and 0.58 on the general ASGS factor. Although loadings were satisfactory for PK, items 15, 16, 17 loaded more highly than on the general factor. Interestingly, these items index personal experience of PK, which are slightly different in tone to the rest of the measure that focuses more on belief. Overall, belief within the ASGS best represented a general factor, particularly in relation to ESP items. However, items related to PK also require consideration.

Omega reliability supported this conceptualization. However, an important degree of variance existed for ASGS subfactors, particularly PK. The poor datamodel fit of the one-factor solution reinforced the validity of the two-factor bifactor solution.

the New Age-related items best measured belief in the paranormal. Removal of LAD items, indexing Traditional Belief, improved model fit. These items added unnecessary complexity to the model. Omission of the LAD subscale is conceptually and psychometrically appropriate because the subscale comprises only two items. Accordingly, LAD fails to assess adequately construct breadth. Additionally, informed advocates of paranormal powers class ESP and PK as forms of psi. This notion derives from the supposition that ESP and PK arise from inexplicable forces beyond the understanding of established physical principles. Hence, there is considerable parapsychological debate about the extent to which the 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P5.51

Hence, there is considerable parapsychological debate about the extent to which the two alleged phenomena share common features and/or overlap . Some theorists have gone so far as to question whether ESP and PK represent a unitary domain . Whereas, other theorists view the two phenomena as complementary, but distinct in terms of characteristics and predisposing conditions. This notion accords with layperson accounts of psi. Thus, although the phenomena share considerable variance, individuals more commonly report ESP experiences and people generally consider the existence of ESP more likely than PK Contrastingly, LAD represents 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P5.68

The RPBS, despite issues with factorial structure, acknowledges this distinction. Explicitly, LAD within the RPBS straddles two separate factors, traditional religious belief continues to exist though the body may die”) and spiritualism (i.e., “It is possible to communicate with the dead”). These are distinct to the psi subscale, which comprises a items, respectively. Overall, Study 1 indicated that the ASGS functions well at a global level.

STUDY 2: INVARIANCE AND CONVERGENT VALIDITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN SHEEP-GOAT SCALE The RPBS due to its breadth and multidimensionality features in a range of empirical research. Indeed, the RPBS is the most widely used measure of paranormal belief within psychology . Conversely, parapsychologists tend to use the ASGS because it focuses on fundamental paranormal concepts (extra-sensory perception, PK and LAD). The preference for the ASGS stems from the fact that the measure evolved within parapsychology, where it subsequently 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P6.02
and LAD). The preference for the ASGS stems from the fact that the measure evolved within parapsychology, where it subsequently developed an acknowledged reputation. The fact that psychology and parapsychology often use different measures to assess belief in the paranormal creates potential issues. Primarily, the concern that results may arise as an artifact of the scale used and may not extrapolate across studies. For these reasons, it is important to ensure that the RPBS and ASGS index the same underlying construct. This is not easy to establish because few studies have used the scales concurrently. When employed together, studies report 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P6.13

When employed together, studies report high positive correlations between the two measures Indeed, the scales share approximately 60% variance. This suggests that the RPBS assesses the core aspects of the paranormal belief indexed by the ASGS (ESP, LAD, and PK). Convergent validity testing will examine the degree of convergence between the ASGS and RPBS. An additional method that tests whether the ASGS is transferable across studies is invariance testing.

This assesses whether measurement interpretation is consistently across contexts and populations (and hence differences reflect true mean variations) or if any observed differences in scores are likely due A paucity of research has examined invariance of the ASGS. Study 2 examined measurement invariance and the convergent validity of the ASGS bifactor model specified in Study 1. Specifically, following analysis of factor structure invariance tests examined whether the bifactor solution was invariant across each of the samples used Evaluating invariance among samples from separate studies and determines whether the ASGS is trustworthy across different studies.

Evaluating invariance among samples from separate studies and determines whether the ASGS is trustworthy across different studies. Furthermore, using structural equation modeling (SEM) in a latent modeling context, Study 2 evaluated the extent to which ASGS scores predicted the RPBS bifactor solution This was important because convergence specifies the extent to which the scales measure general paranormal belief and share conceptual overlap (ESP and PK). In addition, analysis via SEM is preferable to alternative approaches, such as regression analysis, because SEM incorporates a simultaneous assessment of latent constructs and measurement error when assessing relationships This provides a more parsimonious evaluation 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P6.44
SEM incorporates a simultaneous assessment of latent constructs and measurement error when assessing relationships This provides a more parsimonious evaluation of the shared variance among variables. Another advantage of SEM is the assessment of the measurement models in a confirmatory manner prior to testing structural relationships. By focusing on the degree of consistency between data and proposed factor model, SEM offers a rigorous assessment of the scales. This approach ensures that prior to testing structural relationships measures are reliable and fit with the existing a priori conceptions.

Within the sample 95 Respondents were collected following the perimeters outlined in Study 1. Since the original studies looked at a range of beliefs over a period of time instructions told respondents not to participate if they had previously completed research on belief in the paranormal.

Accordingly, theorists generally regard the RPBS as a satisfactory measure of Some critics question the dimensionality of the measure.

the RPBS best represents belief in the paranormal as a general overarching construct comprising several related, but conceptually independent subfactors. Procedure and Ethics Procedure and ethics were identical in Study 1. As in previous projects, when respondents completed the ASGS and RPBS together, scale presentation order was counterbalanced.

Specifically, the established seven-factor bifactor solution acted as the criterion. In this model, a general factor of paranormal belief explained the majority of RPBS variance; therefore, the general factor acted as the dependent variable while controlling for the variance of the seven factors.

Particularly, they provide evidence of a strong relationship with a comparable measure of paranormal belief. Discussion Study 2, revealed high convergent validity between the ASGS and RPBS bifactor solutions. The general ASGS factor despite deriving only from psi related dimensions (ESP and PK) predicted RPBS scores.

A discrepancy relates to the negative relationship between ESP and RPBS in the full model. As the patterns of predictive relations in a bifactor analysis can be the opposite of zero-order correlations. ESP and RPBS possessed an initial r = 0.71. This discrepancy is likely a function of the general ASGS factor assuming variance in the analysis given the relationship between ESP and RPBS emerged as positive after controlling for ASGS. Additionally, Study 2 replicated the factorial structure identified in Study 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P8.72
ESP and RPBS emerged as positive after controlling for ASGS. Additionally, Study 2 replicated the factorial structure identified in Study 1 with a discrete sample of respondents. Particularly, a general ASGS factor accounted for the majority of scale variance and possessed a similar magnitude of average factor loading. PK demonstrated reasonably high factor loadings, ESP recorded a low average factor loading, suggesting that the majority of items likely predict general ASGS. Omega hierarchical estimates supported these results. Measurement invariance tests comparing Study 1 with Study 2 respondents supported configural, weak and strong invariance for the bifactor ASGS solution. Findings confirmed that 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P8.86
Study 1 with Study 2 respondents supported configural, weak and strong invariance for the bifactor ASGS solution. Findings confirmed that the bifactor ASGS model was robust and, to an extent, generalizable. Study 2 also successfully replicated the seven-factor bifactor RPBS OVERALL DISCUSSION Assessment of ASGS structure revealed that a two-factor bifactor model, comprising a general paranormal belief dimension encompassing two discrete but related facets (ESP and PK), demonstrated superior fit. Factor loadings were higher for a general factor and hierarchical omega indicated that a general factor accounted for the majority of variance. These results support the notion that the ASGS 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P9.01
omega indicated that a general factor accounted for the majority of variance. These results support the notion that the ASGS measures general level of paranormal belief and is, for the most part, unidimensional . In practice, findings recommend the use of total scale scores as opposed to independent subscales. An amount of non-redundant variance existed, however, particularly for PK. In addition, ESP and PK subscales were conceptually compatible with their factor labels and demonstrated reliability. These subscales can be utilized when administering the measure, but in the presence of general scale scores. This conclusion is consistent with other published Invariance testing 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P9.24
administering the measure, but in the presence of general scale scores. This conclusion is consistent with other published Invariance testing supported invariance of form, factor loadings and item intercepts across both Studies 1 and 2. These results are encouraging because they suggest that differences in ASGS scores are likely to reflect true mean variations rather than measurement bias, thus supporting future use of the measure across different subpopulations/samples. From a belief measurement perspective, the emergent model was congruent with the view that ESP and PK denote associated forms of phenomena. Indeed, based on global taxonomic features, parapsychology classifies both as 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P9.46
view that ESP and PK denote associated forms of phenomena. Indeed, based on global taxonomic features, parapsychology classifies both as forms of psi. Conceptual overlap arises from the fact that ESP and PK arise from alleged psychic/mental powers, whose existence contravenes established scientific principles. These characteristics apply also to other phenomena. Hence, the term psi embraces further paranormal occurrences, such as precognition and Consideration of individual psi facets reveals that they vary greatly in terms of credibility. This is important in the context of the ASGS because previous empirical work reveals that people generally believe that ESP is more plausible 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P9.69

The LAD subscale undermined scale integrity by adding unnecessary complexity to the measure. Overall, the present findings supported the veracity of previous research, which has used the ASGS as an overall and factorial measure of belief in the paranormal. However, require further evaluation and replication with more reliable measures. Alternatively, in order to increase LAD construct breadth and subscale integrity researchers could generate and assess the effectiveness of additional afterlife-related items. The LAD subscale focuses particularly 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.06
breadth and subscale integrity researchers could generate and assess the effectiveness of additional afterlife-related items. The LAD subscale focuses particularly on the survival hypothesis. This is a broad construct, which necessitates consideration of related concepts, such as religious beliefs and spiritualism. The RPBS acknowledges this. Additionally, reference to ghosts and hauntings would prove useful because these subjects are associated with the afterlife and represent commonly endorsed paranormal beliefs and frequently reported experiences Given the importance of these phenomena it is odd that they are absent The current study suggests that the ASGS and the RPBS are of equal importance. The notion 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.15
that they are absent The current study suggests that the ASGS and the RPBS are of equal importance. The notion that the ASGS is superior claimed that content and psychometric issues undermined RPBS validity. The present paper found that these measures demonstrated good convergent validity. Both index general paranormal belief and function as equivalent measures. This finding corresponded who demonstrated that the ASGS and RPBS produced comparable findings when assessing relationships between belief in the paranormal and susceptibility to probabilistic biases. Clearly, the present results support the notion that outcomes do not vary as a function of using the ASGS 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.24
biases. Clearly, the present results support the notion that outcomes do not vary as a function of using the ASGS or RPBS. This seems obvious, but given the previously published criticism, is an important result worth noting. Accordingly, researchers should feel confident when using either measure of paranormal belief. Limitations Within the present paper, both studies assessed belief in the paranormal at only one point in time. Study 1 evaluated ASGS structure via completion of the measure, and Study 2, used a cross-sectional design to further assess ASGS structure and examine convergent validity between the ASGS and RPBS. This approach 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.33
used a cross-sectional design to further assess ASGS structure and examine convergent validity between the ASGS and RPBS. This approach was potentially problematic because scores may vary over time. In the context of the current study, this was less of a concern because paranormal beliefs generally remain Additionally, both the have previously demonstrated satisfactory test–retest reliability indicating that scores remain relatively unchanging. Concerning ASGS structure, Study 2 replicated the model found in Study 1, indicating that the two-factor bifactor was robust and replicable within an independent sample. Future studies may wish to assess further temporal stability by testing respondents on two 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.43
and replicable within an independent sample. Future studies may wish to assess further temporal stability by testing respondents on two different occasions. In addition, the same items loaded highly relative to a general factor across the two studies. Therefore, it would be beneficial for future research to consider controlling for these items (e.g., as a method factor) when utilizing the ASGS. From a psychometric perspective, the ASGS possesses limitations similar to the RPBS. Particularly, potential response bias arising from an overreliance on positively phrased statements. Typically, scale designers add negative particles (reverse orienting), or use words with an opposite meaning 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.52
overreliance on positively phrased statements. Typically, scale designers add negative particles (reverse orienting), or use words with an opposite meaning (reverse wording) to counter the tendency to agree to questions (acquiescence bias) or select extreme options (extreme responses) . Although, test developers view this in the context of belief scales reversed items are highly problematic . Specifically, they are difficult to comprehend and failure to endorse specific items does not indicate disbelief. With complex notions such as ESP, rejecting particular instances does not necessarily indicate lack of belief in the general domain. For example, a person may not believe it possible 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.61
does not necessarily indicate lack of belief in the general domain. For example, a person may not believe it possible to predict the future via dreams, but may consider that visions and feelings can foretell forthcoming events. For these reasons, positively worded items that represent the degree to which respondents endorse the existence of phenomena appear adequate. Indeed, the performance of the one reversed RPBS item provides support for this contention. This question typically performs poorly in comparison to other scale items (with the exception of the extraordinary life forms subscale). The problem of reversing items generally is that respondents 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.71

This is especially true when a reversed statement is located within a block of standardly This occurs because inattention can produce misappropriate item grouping. This may explain why reversed items frequently load on separate factors and fail to confirm to general factorial models These issues are consistent with the who contend that reversing items is a counterproductive strategy that results in response contamination arising from respondent inattention and confusion. The ASGS is one of the most 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.8
counterproductive strategy that results in response contamination arising from respondent inattention and confusion. The ASGS is one of the most commonly used measures of paranormal belief, it is therefore essential that researchers appreciate the measure’s advantages and limitations. The present study is important because it provides the background for and an overview of the ASGS. Concomitantly, this article advises on scoring and interpretation. Recently, similar work with the RPBS produced conceptual clarity and an implementation framework . In this context, analysis suggests that the measure functions best as an overall measure of paranormal belief. Generally, the study of paranormal belief is 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P10.89
suggests that the measure functions best as an overall measure of paranormal belief. Generally, the study of paranormal belief is of value because such beliefs are widely held within society they are an important aspect of the human condition , and believers (vs. non-believers) demonstrate important differences (psychological, pathological, sociological, etc.) These may influence the way people think, perceive, interpret, and comprehend the world. Hence, the investigation of paranormal belief affords insights into everyday cognitions and behaviors and in doing so contributes to several academic disciplines parapsychology, neuroscience, physics, engineering, and biology).

At a practical level, research on paranormal belief informs understanding of psychological functioning and well-being . Accordingly, well-designed measures help researchers to identify correlates of beliefs, and in doing so advise the development of complex multivariate models. Recently, these have usefully combined belief with cognitive-perceptual personality factors and preferential thinking style. This approach has resulted in the emergence of dual influence models that Additionally, this approach has been highly productive in promoting understanding of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs generally 	Australian Sheep-Goat Scale: P11.43
“Apparitions are wavering, uncertain, semi-intelligent things, and the majority of people still regard it as ludicrous to spend time in examining them, while science thrusts them aside as empty stories.” p. 40 This paper was written in order to provide a summary of research into people’s contemporary experiences of apparitions. The material presented here is different to material presented in other papers at the conference in two main respects: firstly, the majority of material examines experiences from a psychological or parapsychological perspective; and secondly, most of the material covered here, whether 	Early Modern Ghosts: P108
majority of material examines experiences from a psychological or parapsychological perspective; and secondly, most of the material covered here, whether it is from an experiment or an account of an experience, is from present-day sources, as opposed to the early modern period that most of the papers from the conference were covering. The aim of this was to provide the delegates at the conference with an idea of how present-day apparitional experiences are actively researched, in the hope that this might provide fresh perspective on historical and literary accounts of apparitional experiences. Introduction The first major research into the existence of 	Early Modern Ghosts: P108.18
provide fresh perspective on historical and literary accounts of apparitional experiences. Introduction The first major research into the existence of apparitional experiences and the explanations of the causes of apparitions was a census conducted by some of the and the traditions of scientific enquiry that they used to research this continues today. However, apparitional research has always been an area fraught with difficulty when trying to approach it from a parapsychological perspective. When researching cases parapsychologists often encounter two separate problems; emotion and belief. No matter what the perceived cause might be, a person who experiences an “apparition” associates a certain 	Early Modern Ghosts: P108.39
emotion and belief. No matter what the perceived cause might be, a person who experiences an “apparition” associates a certain emotional significance with it. This might be fear due to an unexplainable event or pleasure at seeing a loved one. Whatever the emotional significance might be, the emotional aspects of the experience often influence the reporting of events that the individual experienced. This idiosyncratic influence on the reporting of the event also extends to the personal belief that the individual has applied to the event, which further clouds any “objective facts” that might be gained from the experience. The beliefs that 	Early Modern Ghosts: P108.59
applied to the event, which further clouds any “objective facts” that might be gained from the experience. The beliefs that individuals hold about apparitional phenomena are particularly pertinent here as the commonly held belief is that they are “the spirits of dead people”, often referred to as the spirit hypothesis.2 However, as will be shown here, there have been a number of different explanations offered by researchers to explain the phenomena known as “apparitions”, of which the spirit hypothesis represents only one. Parapsychological research into apparitions has been primarily concerned with defining apparitions, investigating the phenomenological characteristics of the apparitional experience, 	Early Modern Ghosts: P108.79
one. Parapsychological research into apparitions has been primarily concerned with defining apparitions, investigating the phenomenological characteristics of the apparitional experience, and constructing theories about the causes of apparitions. Also outlined here are some of the techniques that have been used in order to investigate the nature of apparitional experiences. Defining apparitions and related phenomena Braude has suggested that it is difficult to describe apparitions without using a particular theoretical framework.3 He initially highlights Price’s definition,4 which he criticised because it used the terms “non-physical”, which implies that it has no objective reality, and the term “human being”, which can be criticised 	Early Modern Ghosts: P109
the terms “non-physical”, which implies that it has no objective reality, and the term “human being”, which can be criticised not only from the perspective that there are a number of reported cases of the apparitions of but also from the perspective that many apparitions reported by people are wearing clothes. The second definition Braude criticises is that proposed by Broad6, where he defines all apparitions as being hallucinations, which is a theoretical assumption and automatically dismisses all of the other theories of apparitions, many of which are covered in a later section. By doing this Broad’s definition places restrictions on 	Early Modern Ghosts: P109.15
theories of apparitions, many of which are covered in a later section. By doing this Broad’s definition places restrictions on the extent to which apparitional experiences can be discussed. For Broad, they are always hallucinations, and therefore only the nature of the hallucination can be discussed. For the purposes of this paper, an adapted version of Thalbourne’s definition of apparitions will be used. This “working definition” is as follows, “A sensory7 experience in which there appears to be present a person or animal (deceased or living) who is in fact out of sensory range of the experient...”.8 In this definition, there is 	Early Modern Ghosts: P109.3
animal (deceased or living) who is in fact out of sensory range of the experient...”.8 In this definition, there is an attempt to offer a purely descriptive definition of the phenomena experience, which is removed from theoretical constraints. As a consequence of this, the definition is very broad. Although it is not strictly a definition of apparitions, one of the most influential categorisations of the different types of apparitions experienced was proposed by Tyrrell, who divided them into four separate categories; experimental apparitions, crisis apparitions, post-mortem apparitions and finally, ghosts.9 Tyrrell’s first category, experimental apparitions, refers to cases where a living 	Early Modern Ghosts: P109.45
experimental apparitions, crisis apparitions, post-mortem apparitions and finally, ghosts.9 Tyrrell’s first category, experimental apparitions, refers to cases where a living person has attempted to deliberately make an apparition of themselves appear to another. One of the most famous examples of an experimental apparition was performed and documented by S. H. Beard, in Gurney et al.’s “Phantasms of the Living”. In December 1882, Beard attempted to project an apparition of himself into the house of his fiancée, Miss L. S. Verity. At 9.30 pm he felt as if he had slipped into a “mesmeric sleep”, where he found himself unable to move.10 	Early Modern Ghosts: P109.6
9.30 pm he felt as if he had slipped into a “mesmeric sleep”, where he found himself unable to move.10 At 10 pm he regained full consciousness and made a note of his experience, determined to reattempt the experience at 12 pm in an effort to make the residents of the house aware of his presence. He went to the house the following day and spoke to the married sister of Miss Verity, who was staying in the house at the time. During their conversation she informed him that; “At about half-past nine she had seen me [Beard] in the passage, 	Early Modern Ghosts: P109.74

During their conversation she informed him that; “At about half-past nine she had seen me [Beard] in the passage, going from one room to another, and at 12 pm, when she was wide awake, she had seen me enter the bedroom and walk around to where she was sleeping, and to take her hair… into my hand.” After hearing this account, Beard shocked the people present even further by producing the note he had made the night before from his pocket.

Beard had for reporting this case, and to the degree he had to prompt Miss Verity to report her experiences of the previous night. These types of cases are rare,12 and it has been suggested that they are very similar to, or possibly the same phenomena as, out-ofbody experiences13. Tyrrell’s second class of apparitions, crisis apparitions, refer to the apparitions of people who are experiencing a crisis event. Death is often the crisis event, and in order to qualify as 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.04
of people who are experiencing a crisis event. Death is often the crisis event, and in order to qualify as this class of apparition, the apparition has to have occurred no more than 12 hours before or after the event, this “12-hour limit” being arbitrarily drawn by Gurney (as reported by Tyrrell). Tyrrell noted that crisis apparitions have two common features; they appear so similar to real human beings that they are often mistaken for that person until they vanish, and they normally occur when people are engaged in everyday activities. Tyrrell’s third class of apparition is the post-mortem apparition. This 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.17
they normally occur when people are engaged in everyday activities. Tyrrell’s third class of apparition is the post-mortem apparition. This refers to an apparition of a person who has been dead for at least 12 hours, and Tyrrell notes that its characteristics are similar to the crisis apparition in the respect that the figure is often life-like and appears suddenly. The apparition commonly tries to convey information unknown to the witness. One of the most frequently cited post-mortem apparitions is the “Chaffin Will” case.14 James Chaffin was a farmer living in North Carolina in the early 1900’s. In 1905 he wrote 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.31
“Chaffin Will” case.14 James Chaffin was a farmer living in North Carolina in the early 1900’s. In 1905 he wrote a will leaving his entire estate to his third son, Marshall, which was attested by two witnesses. In 1919, he appeared to have changed his mind about his will and wrote a second will leaving all of his property equally amongst his four sons. Although this was not witnessed, it was a valid will under North Carolina law, provided that the handwriting could be verified to be his. He hid this copy of the will in the family diary, and wrote a 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.44
could be verified to be his. He hid this copy of the will in the family diary, and wrote a note referring to the will and sewed it into the inside pocket of an overcoat belonging to him, apparently telling no one of either the second will or the note. In September 1921, James Chaffin died due to a fall and all of his property went to his third son, as per the instructions of the original will. In June 1925, James Chaffin’s second son, began to have vivid dreams of his father visiting him at his bedside. In one dream 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.57
James Chaffin’s second son, began to have vivid dreams of his father visiting him at his bedside. In one dream his father appeared to him dressed in his overcoat, pulled it back and said, “ ‘You will find my will in my overcoat pocket.’ ”15 The son then went to his oldest brother’s house, where he found his father’s old overcoat. After undoing the stitching he found the note, and went to his mother’s house with three witnesses, where he found the second will in the family bible. The case then went to court, but the situation was amicably settled out 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.71
the second will in the family bible. The case then went to court, but the situation was amicably settled out of court prior to the judgement after twelve witnesses, including the wife and son of Marshall (Marshall had died within a year of his father) agreed that the handwriting of the will matched the handwriting of James Chaffin. One unusual feature of this particular case is that it occurred during a dream, although it should be noted that there is the possibility that Chaffin’s second son may have forged the note and lied about his experience. Tyrrell’s final class of apparitions 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.84
possibility that Chaffin’s second son may have forged the note and lied about his experience. Tyrrell’s final class of apparitions are simply called ghosts. Ghosts appear to “haunt” places, where they are commonly seen in the same locality on a number of instances, often by different people.16 Ghosts appear to demonstrate less awareness of their surroundings than other classes of apparition, and seem to have a more limited degree of interaction with witnesses. Tyrrell noted that, “…ghosts are more somnambulistic than other classes of apparition, and seem to be less informed by a definite purpose.”17 Tyrrell’s taxonomy of apparitions has generally 	Early Modern Ghosts: P110.98
other classes of apparition, and seem to be less informed by a definite purpose.”17 Tyrrell’s taxonomy of apparitions has generally received acceptance amongst the parapsychological community,18 although he is quick to note that many apparitional cases might fit into multiple classes, and elements of each individual class can be found in others. Bayless, amongst others, has pointed out that non-human apparitions are also reported, such as animals and luminous lights.19 For example, the apparition of the “black dog” has a long tradition in British folklore.20 Defining apparitions is one of the most difficult aspects of apparitional research. Many apparitional experiences have 	Early Modern Ghosts: P111.12
tradition in British folklore.20 Defining apparitions is one of the most difficult aspects of apparitional research. Many apparitional experiences have to be taken on a case-by-case basis, as the characteristics of the experience seem to defy the taxonomies and definitions that might be employed. Employing a particular taxonomy or definition is thwarted further by the addition of a particular theoretical framework in order to explain the cause of the experience. The phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences are an area that is more easily explored as the characteristics can be more easily catalogued from the different case studies. Incidences of Belief and 	Early Modern Ghosts: P111.26
more easily explored as the characteristics can be more easily catalogued from the different case studies. Incidences of Belief and Phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences Incidents of belief in the existence of apparitions or ghosts (as the two terms are often used interchangeably in questionnaires and do not follow the taxonomy outlined by Tyrrell shown above) vary considerably. Palmer’s survey of residents and students in Charlottesville, Virginia, found that 17 percent of the sample believed that they have had an apparitional experience.21 Irwin found that 20 percent of the Australian university students in his sample believed in ghosts.22 Haraldsson et al. 	Early Modern Ghosts: P111.41
experience.21 Irwin found that 20 percent of the Australian university students in his sample believed in ghosts.22 Haraldsson et al. discovered that 31 percent of Icelandic adults in his sample believed they had seen the apparition of a dead person, and that 11 percent believed they had seen the apparition of a living one.23 One of the highest instances of belief in the existence of ghosts was found by Persinger, who found that 32 percent of the Canadians in his sample had seen an apparition of a person or an animal.24 A recent Gallup Poll of a randomly selected, national sample of 	Early Modern Ghosts: P111.55
seen an apparition of a person or an animal.24 A recent Gallup Poll of a randomly selected, national sample of 1,012 Americans found that 38 percent of the sample believed that, “Ghosts or...spirits of dead people can come back in certain places and situations.”25 It should be noted that the incidences of belief in apparitions have to be moderated by the way that the questionnaires and surveys ask about apparitional belief, as it is difficult to avoid any reference to a particular theoretical framework. There is a serious problem when investigating people’s belief in apparitions. There is a difference between having 	Early Modern Ghosts: P111.7
particular theoretical framework. There is a serious problem when investigating people’s belief in apparitions. There is a difference between having the experience and interpreting the experience (although the two can be interrelated). When discussing apparitions there is a predisposition to assume that you are interpreting all apparitional experiences in terms of the spirit hypothesis (this theory is discussed later). However, this places an interpretation of the experience when describing the experience. This is a problem because it dictates what people report in apparitional cases and how they respond to apparitional belief questionnaires. For example, if a person feels that a particular 	Early Modern Ghosts: P111.84
in apparitional cases and how they respond to apparitional belief questionnaires. For example, if a person feels that a particular experience that they had was not an “apparition” (i.e. the spirit of a dead person), but it had a more conventional explanation, then they are less likely to report it as an apparitional experience. This compounds the problems faced by investigators into apparitional experiences because it means that generally it is only people who believe that they have seen the spirit of a dead person who report an apparitional experience. The result of this is that they are more likely to 	Early Modern Ghosts: P111.99
of a dead person who report an apparitional experience. The result of this is that they are more likely to alter the narration of their experience to better fit the interpretation they have placed on the experience, with useful pieces of evidence that might lead another person to an alternative interpretation of the experience being intentionally or unintentionally left out of the narration of the experience. Therefore, when evaluating the evidence of people’s belief in the existence of apparitions, one needs to remember that the people surveyed will be placing their own interpretations on the apparitional experiences that others have had.26 	Early Modern Ghosts: P112.15
to remember that the people surveyed will be placing their own interpretations on the apparitional experiences that others have had.26 Research into the phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences is concerned with, amongst other areas, surveying and cataloguing how different aspects of the apparitional experience can be broken down into duration, realisation by the witness that they are having an experience, what different sensory modalities are activated during an experience. One of the most extensive surveys into the phenomenological characteristics of apparitional experiences was performed by Green and McCreery, who collected over 850 questionnaires from 1968 to 1974 examining apparitional experiences.27 They 	Early Modern Ghosts: P112.31
experiences was performed by Green and McCreery, who collected over 850 questionnaires from 1968 to 1974 examining apparitional experiences.27 They found that the 45 percent of people realised that they were having an apparitional experience immediately, 18 percent did not realise they were having such an experience immediately, but knew before they stopped perceiving it, and five percent realised as the experience ended. 31 percent of Green and McCreery’s sample did not realise that they had an apparitional experience until after the event. However, Green and McCreery do not make the distinction between witnesses who realised that it was an apparitional 	Early Modern Ghosts: P112.47
the event. However, Green and McCreery do not make the distinction between witnesses who realised that it was an apparitional event immediately, and those that did not realise this until sometime after the event.28 Green and McCreery also examined the perceived duration of the experience and found that 20 percent of witnesses felt that the experience lasted for five minutes or more, and 42 percent of witnesses said the experience lasted for 15 seconds or less. They also found evidence to suggest that the majority of apparitional olfactory (eight percent) and no sense involved (four percent, presumably related to a sense 	Early Modern Ghosts: P112.64
suggest that the majority of apparitional olfactory (eight percent) and no sense involved (four percent, presumably related to a sense of presence). The majority of cases involved only one three (nine percent) or more (five percent) senses being stimulated. As can be seen from the above surveys, people report having apparitional experiences, and although researchers might have difficulty in defining what an apparitional experience is, members of the public each seem to have their own idea of what an apparition is and what experiencing an apparition entails. However, explaining the causes of the apparitional experience is a very different matter. Theories on 	Early Modern Ghosts: P112.8
what experiencing an apparition entails. However, explaining the causes of the apparitional experience is a very different matter. Theories on the causes of apparitional experiences can be tentatively divided into subjectivist theories, those that assume that the individuals generate apparitions internally; and objectivist theories, which assume that apparitions have some form of objective reality.29 However, it can be argued that some theories can fall into both categories (e.g. an external environmental effect that causes an internal hallucination). The spirit hypothesis has already been mentioned, and is often assumed to be the primary explanation of the causes of apparitions. In its simplest 	Early Modern Ghosts: P112.96
already been mentioned, and is often assumed to be the primary explanation of the causes of apparitions. In its simplest form, it suggests that an apparition is the part of a person that survives bodily death.30 A variation of this hypothesis was suggested by Perry, who suggested a theory to explain the motivations of a small proportion of these “unquiet dead” might include; an attachment to the location or a person they are haunting, a call for assistance (perhaps to help the apparition deal with “unfinished business”), or the intent on behalf of the spirit to offer comfort to a loved 	Early Modern Ghosts: P113.11
the apparition deal with “unfinished business”), or the intent on behalf of the spirit to offer comfort to a loved one.31 Only a minority of parapsychologists subscribe to the spirit hypothesis now,32 but it is the hypothesis that is most readily imagined by members of the public when the words “apparition” or “ghost” are used. The main problem with this theory is its lack of falsifiability, i.e. that it is difficult to disprove that all reported cases of apparitions are not the spirits of dead people without researching every case of apparitions. Another problem with this theory is that many apparitions 	Early Modern Ghosts: P113.25
the spirits of dead people without researching every case of apparitions. Another problem with this theory is that many apparitions are reported to be wearing clothes or carrying objects, which creates a problem in explaining whether or not objects can survive bodily “death”, however, as apparitions are regularly reported as appearing to have flesh, then it could be equally as easy for the apparition to appear to be wearing clothes too. There are advantages to this explanation, as it might provide great comfort for those that have an apparitional experience. Some witnesses gain satisfaction that a loved one has visited them, 	Early Modern Ghosts: P113.4
great comfort for those that have an apparitional experience. Some witnesses gain satisfaction that a loved one has visited them, and this might be one possible explanation of why many recently widowed persons report seeing their dead spouse.33 An alternative paranormal explanation to the spirit hypothesis is the super-ESP (extra-sensory perception) hypothesis, which suggests that apparitions are not the spirits of the dead, but are the result of a telepathic communication from a living person who knew the dead person.34 Memories about the deceased person are projected by ESP from those who knew them to the person who is having the 	Early Modern Ghosts: P113.54
about the deceased person are projected by ESP from those who knew them to the person who is having the apparitional experience. The person then sees the apparition, which matches the description of the deceased individual due to the intimate knowledge that was projected by those who knew the deceased. This may well be a variation of Gurney et al.’s idea of “contagious telepathy” where they argue that information about an apparitional experience is transmitted through extra-sensory means, almost like an “infection”, which results in others having the same apparitional experience at a later date. Tyrrell examined the idea of telepathic 	Early Modern Ghosts: P113.68
“infection”, which results in others having the same apparitional experience at a later date. Tyrrell examined the idea of telepathic communication of details about a deceased person from a more psychodynamic perspective. He suggested that there was a telepathic communication of an “idea-pattern” into the unconscious mind of the witness, who then used the core material about a deceased person to “flesh-out” their experience, resulting in a dramatic and realistic apparitional experience that can be individualistic, yet the apparition shares enough descriptive characteristics with a deceased person to be able to be recognised as that person.35 A main problem with theories 	Early Modern Ghosts: P113.82
descriptive characteristics with a deceased person to be able to be recognised as that person.35 A main problem with theories that use ESP as a central explanation is that it is still unclear what mechanisms would be employed in order for an individual to acquire information about another’s personality in this manner, but they do begin to offer an explanation of how some groups of individuals can see an apparition collectively, and how information unique to the deceased person who appeared as an apparition can still described by witnesses of the apparition. Another class of theory suggests that apparitions are just hallucinations 	Early Modern Ghosts: P113.97
an apparition can still described by witnesses of the apparition. Another class of theory suggests that apparitions are just hallucinations originating from the mind of the witness. Podmore suggested that all reported cases of apparitions are the result of misinterpretations of ordinary events and the imagination of the witness (i.e. hallucinations). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, defines hallucinations as, “a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ.”36 However, the DSM IV does note that it is possible to have transient 	Early Modern Ghosts: P114.11
external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ.”36 However, the DSM IV does note that it is possible to have transient hallucinations without having a mental disorder. This is important as it suggests that almost anyone can have a full hallucinatory experience, and it is not restricted to individuals with mental disorders. This is similar to an argument proposed by Bentall, who has examined the characteristics of hallucinations. His conclusions are particularly relevant to apparitional research, as his extensive literature review found that it is possible to experience hallucinations due to a stressful experience, such as the loss of a spouse, which 	Early Modern Ghosts: P114.25
that it is possible to experience hallucinations due to a stressful experience, such as the loss of a spouse, which might explain why many widowed persons reported sightings of the loved one they have lost. He also found that it is possible to hallucinate by hyperventilating, which could lead to a “feedback” model where a person misperceives a conventional event, panics and begins to hyperventilate, which results in a hallucination of an apparition. Bentall also found that hallucinations are related to the personality of the witness, and hallucinators do not hallucinate random events, “… visual hallucinators see visions of dead ancestors 	Early Modern Ghosts: P114.39
the personality of the witness, and hallucinators do not hallucinate random events, “… visual hallucinators see visions of dead ancestors and other persons of psychological significance to them.” 37 Bentall also found evidence that suggestion alone can create hallucinations in some participants.38 This is important to apparitional research, as some investigators have proposed that suggestion alone can produce a paranormal experience. Orne suggested that demands of a social situation could influence a participant’s behaviour.39 He found that when a participant was expecting to be put into an altered state of consciousness, they would behave as if they were in the altered 	Early Modern Ghosts: P114.54
expecting to be put into an altered state of consciousness, they would behave as if they were in the altered state, even if no attempt was made to put them in such a state. This idea was applied to apparitional research by Lange et al., who analysed 924 reported cases of apparitional experiences and found that nearly 62 percent of the cases were rated as displaying demand characteristics; namely that there was a direct or indirect suggestion to the witness that the environment would produce paranormal phenomena.40 Lange and Houran tested this idea by taking 22 participants individually around five different 	Early Modern Ghosts: P114.68
the environment would produce paranormal phenomena.40 Lange and Houran tested this idea by taking 22 participants individually around five different areas of a dilapidated theatre, which was normally closed to the public. Eleven of the participants were told that the research was concerned with investigating paranormal activity at the theatre. The other eleven participants were informed that the premises were under renovation and the research was examining people’s reactions to such environments. Participants were asked to report any experiences that they had in the theatre by completing a experiential questionnaire. They found that the “paranormal” group reported significantly more physical, mental, 	Early Modern Ghosts: P114.82
had in the theatre by completing a experiential questionnaire. They found that the “paranormal” group reported significantly more physical, mental, extra-personal and transpersonal experiences than the “renovation” group, and the “paranormal” group also reported more intense emotional reaction to the location compared to the “renovation” group, even though the only difference between the two groups was what they were told about the place beforehand.41 This idea was tested by Wiseman et al., who took 678 participants around The Haunted Gallery and Georgian Rooms at Hampton Court. Half of the participants were told that the “haunted” area they were about to visit 	Early Modern Ghosts: P114.96
Georgian Rooms at Hampton Court. Half of the participants were told that the “haunted” area they were about to visit was associated with a recent increase in reports of unusual phenomena, the other half of the participants were told of no such reports. Wiseman et al. found that this suggestion had no significant effects on the participants’ expectations of experiencing unusual phenomena during the experiment, or on the number of unusual experiences they reported, or to the degree they attributed an unusual experience to a ghost. However, Wiseman et al. suggest that this might have been because The Haunted Gallery has a 	Early Modern Ghosts: P115.1
experience to a ghost. However, Wiseman et al. suggest that this might have been because The Haunted Gallery has a reputation for being haunted, and that the suggestion component was a subtle one.42 When this was combined with the demand characteristics of the participants, it reduced the affect of suggestion given by the experimenters. The issue of group conformity could have also played a part, as it can do when witnesses are describing spontaneous case experiences. Asch found that individual opinion has a tendency to move towards an average opinion held by a group. This is a danger in apparitional reports 	Early Modern Ghosts: P115.24
has a tendency to move towards an average opinion held by a group. This is a danger in apparitional reports where an individual’s description of the characteristics of an experience might change in order to become more like the experiences reported at the same time by others, rather than retaining the uniqueness of the experience.43 As can be seen, there are a complex set of psychological interactions and motivations in apparitional experiences. Another such psychological motivation for reporting an apparitional experience is fraud. Witnesses might decide to put forward fraudulent claims either intentionally or unintentionally, for numerous reasons, but two possible 	Early Modern Ghosts: P115.39
is fraud. Witnesses might decide to put forward fraudulent claims either intentionally or unintentionally, for numerous reasons, but two possible reasons are those that are seeking attention and those that desire profit. An investigation into a reported apparitional experience by academic or non-academic researchers can involve a great deal of work and research, and a considerable amount of time having to be spent with the witness. Whatever the witness’s particular psychological need might be, it can often be represented as a need for attention, which is satisfied by the investigators. This can lead to the experience being elaborated and/or reported as 	Early Modern Ghosts: P115.53
need for attention, which is satisfied by the investigators. This can lead to the experience being elaborated and/or reported as occurring on multiple occasions so that the investigator might be required to spend more time with the witness. Profit seekers might be seeking to create an aura of mystery and “paranormal activity” around the location in order to encourage people to go there. This is obviously a tactic that would be primarily used for locations open to the public. An alternative set of theories examines the environment, instead of the paranormal or psychological, as a possible cause of apparitional experiences. Roll 	Early Modern Ghosts: P115.67
set of theories examines the environment, instead of the paranormal or psychological, as a possible cause of apparitional experiences. Roll and Nichols44 are among a number of researchers who have examined electromagnetic causes for apparitional experiences.45 They investigated 12 sites where, “unexplained footsteps, apparitions, electrical disturbances, strange behaviour by pets and other haunt phenomena were reported.”46 When investigating these sites, they measured electromagnetic fields (EMF), geomagnetic fields (GMF) and ion densities. According to Roll and Nichols, transient EMFs are found in houses with inadequate grounding, and are generated by electronic equipment. GMFs are generally stable, although there are daily fluctuations from 	Early Modern Ghosts: P115.81
houses with inadequate grounding, and are generated by electronic equipment. GMFs are generally stable, although there are daily fluctuations from the sun, cosmic rays, the weather, etc., and local conductors (e.g. water and ore bodies) may generate field fluctuations in the local GMF. Persinger, Tiller and Koren have suggested that exposure to bursts of these variations in the magnetic fields may result in apparitional experiences.47 These experiences of positive ions, which are associated with effects on mood, such as “...increased irritability, depressive moods and restricted respiration.”48 Roll and Nichols found that out of 12 of the sites they investigated at which 	Early Modern Ghosts: P115.95
depressive moods and restricted respiration.”48 Roll and Nichols found that out of 12 of the sites they investigated at which apparitional phenomena had been reported, three sites six sites showed GMF and high positive ion levels were found at seven of the 12 sites. These readings tentatively suggest that increased and transient electromagnetic field strengths, combined with the mood altering properties of increase positive ion densities might lead to an apparitional experience, although more comparative research of locations where apparitions have been seen, and places where no paranormal phenomena have been reported needs to be performed. One of the most recent 	Early Modern Ghosts: P116.09
been seen, and places where no paranormal phenomena have been reported needs to be performed. One of the most recent theories of the causes of apparitions involves the effects that infrasound has on the human body. Back in 1998, Vic Tandy (a researcher at Coventry University), reported on an experience he had when working as an engineering designer.49 When working one night in a laboratory that had a history of being haunted, he began to feel increasingly uncomfortable and depressed, and he was sweating and felt as though there was something else in the room. After having a brief break, he continued 	Early Modern Ghosts: P116.23
was sweating and felt as though there was something else in the room. After having a brief break, he continued to write at his desk, and saw a figure appear in the periphery of his vision which was grey and made no sound. He was terrified, but turned to face the apparition. When he did it disappeared. The next day he returned to the lab to fix a foil blade for a fencing competition he was entering. When he placed the foil in his bench-vice, it began to frantically vibrate up and down. He began to feel frightened again, but realised 	Early Modern Ghosts: P116.37
foil in his bench-vice, it began to frantically vibrate up and down. He began to feel frightened again, but realised for the foil to vibrate it must be receiving energy from somewhere. By experimentation with the blade it was possible to show that low frequency sound (infrasound) was present, specifically a standing wave with a frequency of 18.98 Hz. This frequency is too low for the human ear to hear50, so Tandy could not hear this sound wave. Tandy then proceeded to find out that an infrasound wave of this frequency can vibrate the whole body, which can cause hyperventilation and 	Early Modern Ghosts: P116.51
to find out that an infrasound wave of this frequency can vibrate the whole body, which can cause hyperventilation and panic attacks, and can vibrate the eyes, which can cause a blurring of sight, particularly in the peripheral vision, all of which is consistent with his experience. Tandy also managed to trace the cause of the infrasound wave to a faulty fan, and when the fan was repaired the infrasound wave and the ghost seemed to disappear. Tandy has suggested that infrasound waves might account for certain apparitional sightings, but infrasound waves can be transient and are difficult to detect.51 Tandy 	Early Modern Ghosts: P116.66
infrasound waves might account for certain apparitional sightings, but infrasound waves can be transient and are difficult to detect.51 Tandy is continuing this research and is trying to develop an infrasound detector which is affordable and takes valid measurements of infrasound, the initial tests of the detector seem promising and are necessary in order to test this theory further.52 Only a small number of the proposed causes of apparitions are shown here, but it can be seen that the suggestion that apparitions are the “spirits of the dead”, is only one possible theory amongst many. It is unlikely that one individual 	Early Modern Ghosts: P116.8
apparitions are the “spirits of the dead”, is only one possible theory amongst many. It is unlikely that one individual theory can explain all reported cases of apparitional phenomena, and each case needs to be evaluated individually. It is possible that a combination of different theories needs to be employed in order to understand why people experience apparitions. For example, a person might see an apparition because they are in a nervous state in a location that is reportedly haunted, and yet unconsciously they want to see an apparition. After misperceiving a sound behind them, they turn around and see a 	Early Modern Ghosts: P116.94
yet unconsciously they want to see an apparition. After misperceiving a sound behind them, they turn around and see a hallucination of a person due to their emotional state. They then proceed to tell others about their experience, moderating the report so it more closely matches what others have reported. Approaches to researching apparitional experiences from a parapsychological perspective Researching apparitional experiences is difficult. Witnesses are often emotional, can forget important details about a case and often frame the experience in terms of the spirit hypotheses. As the spirit hypothesis is very difficult (if not impossible) to test, researchers into apparitional 	Early Modern Ghosts: P117.1
terms of the spirit hypotheses. As the spirit hypothesis is very difficult (if not impossible) to test, researchers into apparitional experiences must therefore gain data on the experiences and examine testable hypotheses on the causes of apparitions. Often, the testable hypotheses are those hypotheses that suggest apparitional phenomena are caused by conventional means. Research into apparitional experiences appears to have generally taken the form of four different types of methodology: survey research, laboratorybased replications, field-based experiments, and “ghost hunter” type investigations. These four methodologies are summarised below: Survey Research Survey research into apparitional experiences takes general information from a large number 	Early Modern Ghosts: P117.28
These four methodologies are summarised below: Survey Research Survey research into apparitional experiences takes general information from a large number of witnesses and combines them in order to give a general impression of the characteristics of the apparitional experience. There is normally little or no attempt at trying to see if the phenomena can be explained by conventional causes in this type of research. However, data on the phenomenology and belief that surveys collect can be analysed to see if there are common themes to most experiences. One of the most extensive surveys performed on apparitional experiences was done by Green and 	Early Modern Ghosts: P117.45
common themes to most experiences. One of the most extensive surveys performed on apparitional experiences was done by Green and McCreery.53 From 1968 to 1974 they had a number of postal and radio appeals for first-hand accounts of apparitional experiences. They ended up with 850 completed questionnaires as a product of these appeals. Their questionnaires investigated a number of issues about apparitional experiences, such as: emotional response, time of experience, activity the witnesses were engaged in, what sensory modalities the experience activated, number of experiences, how the experience began and ended, and also about apparitions of the living, dead, animals and 	Early Modern Ghosts: P117.64
activated, number of experiences, how the experience began and ended, and also about apparitions of the living, dead, animals and objects. Their research provided a great deal of information about the phenomenology and correlates of the apparitional experience. Another area of survey research is examining how many people believe in the existence of ghosts. One of the most recent surveys was the Gallup Poll, where a telephone survey of 1,012 American adults revealed that 38 percent of the sample believed in the existence of ghosts. Trying to replicate an apparitional experience under laboratory conditions is difficult and problematical at best due 	Early Modern Ghosts: P117.81
the existence of ghosts. Trying to replicate an apparitional experience under laboratory conditions is difficult and problematical at best due to the spontaneous nature of the phenomena and the ethical issues in performing research of this type. However, it is possible to place an individual into a “psychomanteum”, where they might have an apparitional experience. The term “psychomanteum” has been defined as, “spirits of the dead are summoned as a means of divination so that they can be asked questions about the future or other hidden knowledge.”55 However, in the laboratory the psychomanteum is a booth or chamber which has black 	Early Modern Ghosts: P117.99
the future or other hidden knowledge.”55 However, in the laboratory the psychomanteum is a booth or chamber which has black curtains all around it. Inside the booth there is a comfortable chair and a mirror on one of the walls. The mirror is angled so that the person sitting in the chair cannot see their own reflection. A candle is normally placed behind the person to create subdued light. The individual then sits in the chair and relaxes, and begins to stare at the mirror. Some studies have found that over half of the participants who have been in the psychomanteum 	Early Modern Ghosts: P118.15
stare at the mirror. Some studies have found that over half of the participants who have been in the psychomanteum report experiencing the visual appearance of a deceased person,56 and that this encounter can be very vivid and in different sensory modalities, with some participants being convinced that the person is there. This method can be helpful in the grieving process57 and the experience can be enhanced by the suggestion that the individual will see a deceased person. Sherwood has suggested that this experimental set-up could result in the participant experiencing hypnogogic or hypnopomic imagery58, which might help to explain why, 	Early Modern Ghosts: P118.3

possible to uncover some of the psychological and environmental cues that make an individual more likely to have an apparitional experience. A key example of a field-based experiment was the experiment performed by Lange and Houran in a disused theatre which was mentioned earlier,60 but another example was the experiment conducted by Maher and Hansen.61 Their experiment involved taking a group of “sensitives” (those that felt they could sense an apparition) individually around a reportedly haunted residential building in New York City. Both groups were asked to note down where in the building they felt that a ghost might be. Maher 	Early Modern Ghosts: P118.61
City. Both groups were asked to note down where in the building they felt that a ghost might be. Maher and Hansen found no significant different between the accuracy of the sensitives and skeptics guesses when comparing both groups to previously reported sightings.63 These field experiments are useful for further understanding the apparitional experience, but in these types of experiment very little attempt is made to find out what the cause of previous reports of apparitional experiences might be. “Ghost hunter” Type Investigations This is probably the most traditional form of research into apparitional experiences, and is also the best known. The 	Early Modern Ghosts: P118.76
Investigations This is probably the most traditional form of research into apparitional experiences, and is also the best known. The techniques are reviewed by a number of popular books,64 and a number of local and national organisations actively research cases in this manner. Although individual investigators have their own, distinctive styles, in general the investigation proceeds in the following order after the case has come to the attention of the investigators; initial interview of witnesses, visit the site of the experiences and examine it, take photographs and make a plan of the site, perform a thorough investigation of the site, including 	Early Modern Ghosts: P118.92
and examine it, take photographs and make a plan of the site, perform a thorough investigation of the site, including locations of any objects (e.g. hidden pipes) that might offer a conventional explanation of the experiences. Then the investigation might extend to staying at the location during the day or overnight so that the investigators can witness the phenomena first-hand. Different types of equipment might be used, such as cameras, camcorders, electromagnetic-field measuring equipment, night-vision goggles and flour (for footprints). The equipment and the procedure used often depend upon the types of hypotheses that the investigators might be examining. For example, 	Early Modern Ghosts: P119.07
equipment and the procedure used often depend upon the types of hypotheses that the investigators might be examining. For example, if the investigators feel from the initial interview with the witnesses that the cause of the phenomena might be due to misinterpretation of conventional events on behalf of the occupiers, they might try to show how this might have happened. Unfortunately, investigations are rarely this straightforward. Because of the fact that spontaneous case investigations take place in the “real-world” and not the laboratory, it is difficult for the investigators to limit the amount of variables that they are to measure and 	Early Modern Ghosts: P119.22
the laboratory, it is difficult for the investigators to limit the amount of variables that they are to measure and test, and it is therefore difficult to conclude anything definitive from a single-case investigation, unless it has a very clear conventional explanation. This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that many cases are brought to the attention of investigators because the witnesses feel that the location is haunted by the spirit of a dead person. This means that the witnesses’ interpretation moderates their reported experience and their expectations of the findings of the investigators. This can potentially lead to an 	Early Modern Ghosts: P119.37
interpretation moderates their reported experience and their expectations of the findings of the investigators. This can potentially lead to an ethical problem for the investigators if they find a conventional cause for the phenomena that the witnesses feel is comforting and paranormal in origin; do the investigators report their actual findings and risk upsetting the witness? Or do they lie and confirm the witnesses’ expectations? Do ghosts exist? – Summary and Conclusions This paper summarises only a fraction of the literature on researching apparitional experiences from a parapsychological perspective.

on researching apparitional experiences from a parapsychological perspective. However, it does present some of the difficulties in researching apparitional experiences. Not only is the term “apparition” difficult to define, but also the fact that “ghost” and “apparition” are so easily associated with the spirit hypothesis creates further difficulties in trying to tease out the experience from the interpretation. Hopefully the problems and issues highlighted here will provide researchers who are examining material from the early modern period with more tools and a wider perspective.

a wider perspective. Interdisciplinary interactions are very useful, and hopefully parapsychologists and other researchers examining contemporary reports can learn a lot from the techniques that are used to research historical cases, such as the methods that are employed and the types of conclusions that can be drawn. This paper has highlighted the difficulty in answering the question, “Do ghosts exist?” People have apparitional experiences and appear to believe in the existence of ghosts, but there are other possible explanations apart from the spirit hypothesis for explaining the causes of these experiences.

four-year longitudinal research programme investigating the effect of local geomagnetic field fluctuations and meditation on receptive psi has been initiated at a Tibetan monastery in Scotland. This Note is intended to give the theoretical background for this research programme. Research findings from several disparate disciplines have been synthesized into a model that can be used to understand associations of both environmental variables and a person’s state of consciousness with an individual’s performance in controlled psi tests.

controlled psi tests. Initially a description of the evidence for both geomagnetic activity (GMA) and meditation relationships with psi is presented. Since GMA exhibits variation by season, and possibly lunar phase, relationships between these cycles and psi are also considered. A theory that connects these variables is then presented, drawing on evidence that GMA may affect the function of the pineal gland within the human brain, and research that suggests that the pineal gland may produce psi-conducive neurochemicals.

These plasma ejections can be due to spectacular explosions on the sun, known as solar flares, which are most common at the peak of the sun’s approximately 11-year activity cycle, or they can be due to coronal holes, lower density areas of the sun’s atmosphere, that have ‘open’ 1An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 53rd Parapsychological Association Convention, Paris, 2010. activity); these fluctuations are 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P0.61

In this respect, Spottiswoode’s LST findings can be regarded as primarily due to seasonal effects.

Distinguishing a lunar from a solar effect can be problematic because the interval between two successive lunar phases (the synodic period) of 29.5 days is close to the rate of solar rotation, which is approximately 27 days. As the sun is a gaseous body, its rotation varies by latitude and is fastest at the equator. In addition, features such as sunspots can shift in position from 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P4.84

This can make it challenging to differentiate between solar and lunar effects, particularly when short periods are studied. THEORETICAL MODEL The Link between Geomagnetic Activity and the Pineal Gland have all suggested that the GMA relationship with psi might be connected with the pineal gland. More specifically, Persinger’s studies have associated the temporal lobes with the interaction between magnetic fields and psi. He has shown that anomalous perceptions and impressions can be artificially induced by applying temporally complex, weak-intensity 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P5.32
fields and psi. He has shown that anomalous perceptions and impressions can be artificially induced by applying temporally complex, weak-intensity (comparable to GMA) who noticed the reported that practitioners of Transcendental Meditation displayed increased partial epileptic-type signs, which are related to the temporal lobes. Thus, the suggestion is that, as artificial and natural magnetic fields can induce psi-type experiences, and as spontaneous psi occurs in people with epilepsy and other temporal lobe sensitivity, that possibly the pineal gland is a mediator for a psi-conducive state of consciousness being induced by changes in the magnetic field. This suggestion is supported by the formation in the 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P5.84
state of consciousness being induced by changes in the magnetic field. This suggestion is supported by the formation in the pineal gland of psi-conducive neurochemicals which are identical to those found in the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca, used by shamans in the Amazonian region. The Link between the Pineal Gland, Psychedelic Tryptamines and Psi have all noted the similarity between traditional psychedelic-induced shamanic initiations that include DMT-like substances, NDEs, alien abduction experiences, and heightened psychic sensitivity. Harmala alkaloids (chemically similar to pinoline) So it is possible that the pineal gland is involved in making neurochemicals which create a psi-conducive state of consciousness particularly at night, 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P6.42
possible that the pineal gland is involved in making neurochemicals which create a psi-conducive state of consciousness particularly at night, but also when there are changes in GMA. Also, traditionally, mediums used to work in the dark and at night, so it could well be that this is a psi conducive period linked with the pineal gland’s production of pinoline and DMT. The pineal gland is influenced both by the night-day cycle and by changes in GMA. Thus, geomagnetic fluctuations, originating from solar emissions and modulated by seasonal and lunar phase periods, may well be directly stimulating the pineal gland causing secretions of psi-conducive 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P7.02
and modulated by seasonal and lunar phase periods, may well be directly stimulating the pineal gland causing secretions of psi-conducive neurochemicals. Further, it is interesting to note that yogic traditions consider the pineal gland to be the physical aspect of ajna chakra, the third eye, which they consider to be the medium for psychic experiences. The Link between Meditation and Psi state that when one attains samadhi the “siddhis” (psychic powers) manifest. In meditation there is internal and external noise reduction, and various psycho-physiological correlates, such as EEG alpha rhythm and increased skin resistance, all of which have been found to be associated who 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P7.46

The controls gave no significant prestimulus response. Most of the recent research has looked at the effect of meditation on active psi, which is not directly relevant to this review. However, the term meditation in all the studies mentioned so far has been used in 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P7.9
directly relevant to this review. However, the term meditation in all the studies mentioned so far has been used in a very loose way, since many different forms of meditation were practised including: mandala gazing, which is focusing attention on a specific type of picture; pranayama, which comprises a variety of breath techniques; kundalini yoga, which is primarily concentration on energy points called chakras and the energy channels between them; mantra yoga, which is sometimes known as transcendental meditation (TM) strongly suggested that meditation is related to conscious psi awareness, in that meditators with more than 20 years of practice showed more consistent psi-hitting 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P8.33

Summary of the Theoretical Perspective We have seen that thirty years of research strongly suggests a link in various different ways between GMA and psi experiences. However there are many 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P8.75
years of research strongly suggests a link in various different ways between GMA and psi experiences. However there are many anomalies in the findings and the cause of the relationship is still only partially explored. One possibility is that changes in the GMA may affect the pineal gland to make endogenous neurochemicals which are similar to those used in shamanic rituals. There is strong evidence that the pineal’s activity is affected by GMA. Anthropological and neurochemical evidence points to the role of pinoline made in the pineal gland creating an endogenous Ayahuasca-type hallucinogen. Amazonian shamans use Ayahuasca for psychic purposes, which suggests that the 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P9.17
in the pineal gland creating an endogenous Ayahuasca-type hallucinogen. Amazonian shamans use Ayahuasca for psychic purposes, which suggests that the pineal neurochemicals may be psi-conducive. Yogis consider that meditation can affect one’s psi ability, and there are meditation techniques which specifically target ajna chakra, whose physical location is considered to be the pineal gland. Therefore, it is possible that one potential explanation for the psi-conducive nature of meditation may related to activation of the pineal gland during the practice. These relationships are shown in Figure 1. by exploring the features of local GMA that may modulate performance in receptive psi trials. The GMA-psi literature 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P9.58
Figure 1. by exploring the features of local GMA that may modulate performance in receptive psi trials. The GMA-psi literature shows an anomaly in that on some occasions increased GMA is related to psi and on others decreased GMA is related to psi. This may be connected with differences between active or receptive psi – or it may be that investigating local GMA where the different bands can be discriminated will resolve the anomaly. By gathering data from the same population over a four year period it will be possible to look at the effect of lunar, seasonal, and sunspot cycles on the GMA-psi 	Geomagnetic Activity, Meditation and PSI: P9.99
year period it will be possible to look at the effect of lunar, seasonal, and sunspot cycles on the GMA-psi correlation. The two main reasons for working with meditators is the evidence that they are a potentially psi-conducive population, and the proximity of Samye Ling Tibetan Centre to Eskdalemuir Observatory, which is in the same valley. The Eskdalemuir Observatory is Britain’s first purpose built geological 11 Roney-Dougal, Ryan and Luke Geomagnetic Activity and Psi: Literature Review and Theoretical Model observatory and gathers extremely high quality measurements of the geomagnetic field at a time resolution of 1-second.

The primary hypotheses being tested in this study are that psi scoring will be related to the different frequencies (bands) and that psi scoring will be positively correlated with years of meditation practice. A number of other exploratory hypotheses are also being tested such as lunar and seasonal variations in psi and its relationship to temporal lobe lability, and the psychological effects of meditation.

of people who have survived death have captured the attention of mainstream audiences. Why do these ideas enjoy persistent and widespread success in contemporary Western culture? Adopting a cognitive approach to the study of afterlife accounts and drawing upon our own research, we argue that mainstream survival narratives are popular because they provide convincing evidence that one has journeyed to another realm. Such accounts are convincing, in part, because they meet default cognitive assumptions about what human survival would look like if it were possible. We support this claim by 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P0.01
meet default cognitive assumptions about what human survival would look like if it were possible. We support this claim by highlighting recurring common themes in recounted episodes of neardeath experiences and past life accounts and outlining how key findings in the cognitive science of religion, in conjunction with culturally situated accounts, can help scholars concerned with ideas about anomalous experiences to better understand their appeal. From around the mid-twentieth century, Western media has capitalized increasingly on accounts of seemingly reputable cases of life after death.

of life after death. The general population is enamoured with tales of people who claim that they experienced rich sensations and perceptions while either close to death or clinically dead1 In these NDE narratives, people often describe feelings of detachment from one’s body (often accompanied by seeing one’s own body from above); meeting deceased friends, relatives, or other spirits; undergoing a life review or that of others); feelings of transcending time and space; and sensing that Other narratives present personal accounts of reincarnation, the idea that after biological death a person leaves his or her mortal body and returns to the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P1.05

huge success. An entire business empire generating hundreds of millions of dollars rests on the persuasiveness of personal accounts of individuals claiming to have had such experiences. How can scholars explain the popularity of these survival accounts? To date, the standard response from social scientists concerned with anomalous experiences3 is to explain the transmissive success of ideas by locating them in a historically situated socio-cultural context. For instance, particular ideas about past lives in contemporary America may well have a competitive advantage over other accounts because they are tailored to suit 1 Definitions of what constitutes death vary considerably; here, clinical 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P1.52

See Younger, Arnold, and Schapiro for more details. 2 E.g., see Bowman 2012; Edelmann and Bernet 2007; Haraldsson 1997; Lyons 2013; Moye 2014; Stevenson 2001; Tucker 2013; Wallis 1999; Weiss and Weiss 2012. 3 There is debate amongst scholars over how to construe these phenomena For simplicity, we refer to them here as anomalous experiences. a quintessentially modern, eclectic brand of New Age spirituality and religious individualism that has become 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P1.75

It may also be the case that, for example, remembering something from a previous existence is readily taken as evidence of reincarnation by those who have already become disenchanted with the conventional Judeo- 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P1.99
previous existence is readily taken as evidence of reincarnation by those who have already become disenchanted with the conventional Judeo- Christian canon. We contend that while cultural factors are necessary to explain the transmissive success of survival narratives, they are not sufficient. Consider the marked variation between NDE accounts. Variation in reports may well be explained by cultural differences and modes of conceptualizing geophysical space. For instance, while experiences of journeys to another realm are found throughout the world, the means of transport vary: in North America, people often speak of traveling though a tunnel, whereas in Melanesia, people tend to 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P2.2
of transport vary: in North America, people often speak of traveling though a tunnel, whereas in Melanesia, people tend to report ascending ladders or walking along roads Likewise, the appearance or overall milieu of the afterlife realm can and does often vary significantly. But even among culturally— and individually—idiosyncratic NDEs, the basic structural features of one’s spirit traveling to another realm and interacting with other deceased souls who dwell there are remarkably consistent.4 These similarities must also be explained. Furthermore, they align with basic assumptions about the afterlife that recur cross-culturally: namely, that the essential identity or personality of an individual 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P2.4
align with basic assumptions about the afterlife that recur cross-culturally: namely, that the essential identity or personality of an individual (i.e., “consciousness”) exists apart from the body, survives biological death, and travels to some other dimension inhabited by social others . It is likely that belief in an inhabited afterlife realm has as much do with our species’ cognitive predispositions as it does fears of one’s own eventual demise, as people tend to view the death of a loved one as resulting in a change to their physical location A cognitive approach thus helps to explain why some survival narratives— including 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P2.61
resulting in a change to their physical location A cognitive approach thus helps to explain why some survival narratives— including that we survive death, in what form this survival takes, and what constitutes evidence for this survival—enjoy widespread cultural success despite differences in propositional beliefs about life after death. In this paper, 4 Not all researchers agree on what features are universal within NDE accounts. For an overview Corazza and we outline how research in the cognitive science of religion (CSR)—including the results of our own primary research—can shed light on the popularity of two phenomena, near death experiences and 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P2.82
(CSR)—including the results of our own primary research—can shed light on the popularity of two phenomena, near death experiences and past life beliefs, which, although seemingly different in terms of content, are underpinned by similar assumptions about personal survival. In short, we propose that some survival narratives are popular because they are convincing, and they are convincing, in part, because they meet intuitive expectations about what human survival would look like if it were possible. Over the past twenty-five years or so, CSR has mounted evidence to suggest that recurrent features of religious and other types of extraordinary phenomena— like other 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P3.03
so, CSR has mounted evidence to suggest that recurrent features of religious and other types of extraordinary phenomena— like other aspects of popular culture—arise in large part through default intuitions about the natural world The rationale behind this empirical discipline is summarized by Boyer and Walker: An account of religious representations requires an explanation of their cognitive salience. If we focus on the recurrent patterns underlying the apparent diversity of religious representations, it appears that they are constrained by a small number of principles that are part and parcel of This approach is grounded in a selectionist framework, which proposes that 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P3.24

Thus far CSR has focused more on the assumptions underpinning postmortem survival to explain traditional theological accounts of life after death, but the approach also has 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P3.46
on the assumptions underpinning postmortem survival to explain traditional theological accounts of life after death, but the approach also has the potential to explain why some descriptions of personal survival in popular Western culture are especially compelling, even when they are divorced from mainstream theological doctrine. From this perspective, the core features of popular survival narratives showcase contemporary Western society’s assumptions about the afterlife, which are largely tractable to panhuman predispositions concerning the representation of persons, minds and bodies. The intuitive appeal of these stories is not limited to those who purport to believe in supernatural phenomena, and thus cannot be 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P3.67
appeal of these stories is not limited to those who purport to believe in supernatural phenomena, and thus cannot be explained away as a product of propositional beliefs. For example, although commercial success reveals that past life narratives routinely attract considerable interest and media attention, only around 20 percent of Americans actually believe that reincarnation is possible, and even fewer believe that they themselves have lived before (see Haraldsson 2006; Walter 2001; White, Kelly, and In addition, ideas about reincarnation are often presented as having credence through corresponding parapsychological research5 about what constitutes “legitimate” evidence for life beyond death. For example, 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P3.89
often presented as having credence through corresponding parapsychological research5 about what constitutes “legitimate” evidence for life beyond death. For example, the late Ian Stevenson provided the most extensive treatment of past-life research to date, documenting approximately 3,000 case reports of people from around the world who presumably possessed memories of their previous lives Stevenson 2001; for an overview of Stevenson, see Tucker 2007; see also Tucker From a cognitive perspective, ongoing research on reincarnation depends more upon parapsychologists’ implicit reasoning about how one would verify whether or not it exists than simply believing, ipso facto, that it does exist. These empirical 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P4.11
how one would verify whether or not it exists than simply believing, ipso facto, that it does exist. These empirical practices for assessing the veridicality of afterlife claims tend to correlate with how ordinary people think about consciousness. In what follows, we outline three recurrent themes that appear throughout popular narratives about life after death and showcase how these standard inferences can often be understood within the materialist framework of CSR.

Knowledge Among the vast array of NDE reports, the most popular—and championed as the most persuasive—are those in which people allegedly acquire information during their death/near-death state or previous life that they could not possibly have known before. These cases are often highlighted because the information contained within them is specific and (according to parapsychologists) later verified as accurate. Both forms of knowledge rely on memories of having lived—and often, having died—before. In the context of past life 5 Although mainstream academics have debated how best to construe the investigation of such phenomena (e.g., as psychical, occult, paranormal, supernatural, etc.), here 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P4.56

For instance, Stevenson reports the case of Ravi Shankar Gupta as evidence of reincarnation. He recalled eating guavas before being taken to the riverside where he was murdered. This description was consistent with the murder of a boy named Munna Prasad decades before, and so the memory was interpreted as support for the claim that Gupta was Prasad reborn . Here, the phenomenon of reincarnation is given credence by certain empirical facts: the memory of a distinctive previous-life event conforms 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P5.01
Here, the phenomenon of reincarnation is given credence by certain empirical facts: the memory of a distinctive previous-life event conforms to a factual record, one including details of which the person in question would not have any known access. Popular accounts of NDEs likewise contain the assumption of privileged knowledge. For example, after a patient was pronounced clinically dead, a nurse had removed his dentures and placed them on a nearby tray. Over a week later, the same recovering patient spotted the nurse and exclaimed that she must know where the missing dentures were because he recalled being out of his 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P5.2
the nurse and exclaimed that she must know where the missing dentures were because he recalled being out of his body during intubation and having witnessed her removing them . For further illustration, consider the case of social worker who reported an NDE case in which she visited a patient in a hospital who was recovering from a heart attack. The patient, named Maria, claimed that while she was being resuscitated she had found herself floating above the hospital, and remembered having noticed a blue tennis shoe on the ledge of the building. Out of curiosity, Clark-Sharp investigated and did, in 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P5.38
having noticed a blue tennis shoe on the ledge of the building. Out of curiosity, Clark-Sharp investigated and did, in fact, find a shoe precisely matching the one described by Maria and in the same spot where Maria reported seeing it. This particular example, notable for its specific imagery, is often presented as one of the strongest to suggest that memories of out-of-body perceptions occurring during NDEs coincide with objective reality, and as such this case is routinely presented (and contested) in NDE-related literature.6 In the context of NDEs, cases imply that perceptions occurring during the experience have a basis in 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P5.57
in NDE-related literature.6 In the context of NDEs, cases imply that perceptions occurring during the experience have a basis in objective reality and support the idea that consciousness occurs outside of the body and independently of the brain. In past life reports, they assume that a person can remember their past life and appeal to the audience as empiricists, who weigh up the likelihood of two people having the same experience. Both NDE and past-life reports assume that the 6 This case is often repeated as strong evidence for the objective reality of NDE perceptions, even though Maria has never been 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P5.75
case is often repeated as strong evidence for the objective reality of NDE perceptions, even though Maria has never been located and there is no corroborating evidence beyond person retains their identity across dramatic biological physical changes—including biological death and rebirth. B Psychological Immortality Underpinning case studies of life after death is the fundamental assumption that the ethereal mind continues apart from the physical body, an entity that may remain the same, change radically, or even be shed or otherwise discarded by the spirit at the moment of death. One study found that 58 percent of people reporting near-death experiences felt 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P5.94
by the spirit at the moment of death. One study found that 58 percent of people reporting near-death experiences felt as if they inhabited a new body at although oftentimes people report lacking any kind of body during the experience. For instance, Allan Pring recounts that while he was undergoing a surgical procedure, he suddenly found himself in a “different place” where he claimed, “I knew that I no longer had a physical existence. I was not conscious of having a body and the only senses that I was aware of were sight and sound, but even these were While conducting 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P6.14
body and the only senses that I was aware of were sight and sound, but even these were While conducting an ethnography of groups in Santa Barbara that provide support to those who claim to have had NDEs, Kinsella found most participants were convinced that NDEs provided solid evidence that, in the words of one interviewee, “we are spiritual beings having a temporary, embodied experience” Overall, the sum of NDE reports reflect the widespread assumption that, as developmental psychologist Paul Bloom states, “we do not feel as Bloom’s claim is situated in a growing body of research in the social cognitive 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P6.35
states, “we do not feel as Bloom’s claim is situated in a growing body of research in the social cognitive sciences, which suggests that ideas about NDEs and past lives conform to intuitive assumptions about the constitution of identity for persons, often referred to as folk-dualism. Research indicates that humans are predisposed to represent persons as composed of multiple “substances”: material bodies and immaterial properties such as minds or “essences” On the one hand, other organisms in our environment are tracked fundamentally as physical, bodily objects; on the other hand, they are also represented as mindful, psychological beings, guided in their 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P6.57
fundamentally as physical, bodily objects; on the other hand, they are also represented as mindful, psychological beings, guided in their behavior by unobservable mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires, intentions). There is a general scholarly consensus that people everywhere represent themselves and others as being constituted by non-physical properties, hereafter “minds” for convenience The cognitive science of religion has mounted evidence to suggest that these intuitive tendencies concerning the representation of persons also explain some of the cross-culturally recurrent features of supernatural agents, such as gods, ghosts, ancestors, and possessed spirits. Although we find many diverse examples of minds without bodies or 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P6.78
agents, such as gods, ghosts, ancestors, and possessed spirits. Although we find many diverse examples of minds without bodies or minds inhabiting other bodies, one constant feature in popular portrayals of supernatural agents is that the individual agent has a mind and, therefore, intentionality 2008; Barrett 1999; Bering 2002; Bloom 2004; Boyer 2001; Cohen and Barrett Likewise, the same intuitions—that people’s minds are represented as retaining their personal identity—may explain why some accounts concerning the veracity of near-death experiences and reincarnation are so widely accepted. Many NDE reports include meetings with deceased relatives who retain identifiable characteristics even though they 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P7
reincarnation are so widely accepted. Many NDE reports include meetings with deceased relatives who retain identifiable characteristics even though they may appear to be considerably different Such evidence of the continuation of personality after physical death is also routinely presented in other kinds of phenomena addressed by parapsychology, such as mediumship, in which the spirits of loved ones presumably make contact with the living and do so while retaining their unique personality traits, adding to the plausibility that the medium has, in fact, successfully made contact with the deceased . Such accounts seem to betray a default cognitive operation behind popular 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P7.21
in fact, successfully made contact with the deceased . Such accounts seem to betray a default cognitive operation behind popular survival narratives. They assume not only that memories are the most accurate test of personal continuity after death, but also that the capacity to remember—perhaps more than any other type of mental functioning— somehow survives biological cessation. This observation is in line with current findings in the cognitive science of religion, which indicate that from a young age, we find it easier to represent some biological needs and related psychological states as ceasing after death (e.g., the need to eat: feeling 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P7.43
easier to represent some biological needs and related psychological states as ceasing after death (e.g., the need to eat: feeling hungry) than non-physically based states, such as remembering One potential cognitive mechanism proposed as being responsible for generating this selective bias in our innate representations of what the dead do and do not routinely experience has been referred to as a simulation constraint. In the context of thinking about what the afterlife is “like,” this refers to the inability to conceive of ourselves as “being” dead and unconscious, because we use To be clear, this does not mean that you cannot 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P7.64
of ourselves as “being” dead and unconscious, because we use To be clear, this does not mean that you cannot imagine what life would be like after you are dead (e.g., your funeral, your children’s birthdays, etc.), but such a construal requires a first-person perceptive lens through which you envision and Roazzi, these future events. This imaginative obstacle means that it is easier to represent your dead self, and correspondingly, dead others, as continuing to exist mentally—just elsewhere, whether in a different body or a different realm (see One parapsychological example of this hurdle of consciously representing non-consciousness is the common 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P7.86
different body or a different realm (see One parapsychological example of this hurdle of consciously representing non-consciousness is the common “life review” aspect of NDEs, which involves the feeling of reliving (or witnessing) significant autobiographical events and reflecting meaningfully upon these deeply personal memories that have accumulated over a lifetime. One woman, speaking of her own NDE at age fifteen, states: Suddenly, wooosh I was going up through this tunnel … And then the next thing I knew, I was out in this gray misty place … And then this man came towards me—like a misty light-filled-in outline—and he said, “Come 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P8.08
in this gray misty place … And then this man came towards me—like a misty light-filled-in outline—and he said, “Come with me and I’ll show you your life.” The thing I most remember having pointed out to me was when I was throwing stones at my brothers and sister. I was about 9 or 10, and I was really angry and frustrated … and they were really upset. [Seeing this] I was ashamed, and then he took me away from that.

Sutherland 1995: 148 Memories of having lived before serve as lay verification cues for people around the world, often under very different circumstances. In places where every ancestor is thought to return to the human world, such as some cultures in West Africa, South Asia, and northwestern North America, newborn children are often examined for distinguishing mental recollections that correspond to characteristics of the deceased Ideas about the continuity of memory in reincarnation are also apparent in elaborate rituals in efforts to determine which Lamas have been reborn and who manifests these revered souls presently The most well-known example of such 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P8.5
to determine which Lamas have been reborn and who manifests these revered souls presently The most well-known example of such a tradition is the search for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, a formalized ritual that depends crucially upon a candidate child’s ability to distinguish amongst various objects those which belonged to the deceased Dalai Lama, thus inferring that the child remembers the object from his previous life Furthermore, recent research has shown that intuitions about memory serve as robust evidence of reincarnation for many practitioners of New Age spirituality. found that New Age spiritual seekers in the U.S. regard the 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P8.71
of reincarnation for many practitioners of New Age spirituality. found that New Age spiritual seekers in the U.S. regard the memory of a specific past life event as constituting stronger evidence that the person has lived before than any other potential cue, such as an inexplicable behavior, physical marks or factual information. These intuitions about the centrality of memory in establishing reincarnation are not simply a product of being enculturated in such a belief system. White (2015a; conducted a series of studies with Jains in Southern India, who believe in reincarnation, and Americans who endorse stereotypical Judeo-Christian views of life after 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P8.92
studies with Jains in Southern India, who believe in reincarnation, and Americans who endorse stereotypical Judeo-Christian views of life after death. Despite major differences in their explicitly stated beliefs, when presented with a suite of memory-based cues, both sets of naive participants reasoned similarly upon being given a hypothetical reincarnation challenge for “matching” fictional living people with their deceased counterparts. Specifically, individuals intuitively privileged a shared episodic memory (memory of a specific biographical event) as evidence for reincarnation over various combinations of other types of memory (e.g., procedural) and physical features (e.g., physique). Being in a hypothetical conscious state without 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P9.13
combinations of other types of memory (e.g., procedural) and physical features (e.g., physique). Being in a hypothetical conscious state without memories appears especially difficult to imagine. Indeed, research suggests that people regard memories, and certain kinds of memories in particular, as more likely to remain constant over physical transformations than any other psychological attributes. For participants reasoned that personal identity remains intact Jim”) so long as the target’s (Jim’s) memories are preserved. This memory-identity effect panned out even when the individual was described as undergoing dramatic physical changes: from person to robot, robot to microchip, and then microchip inserted into a 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P9.32
was described as undergoing dramatic physical changes: from person to robot, robot to microchip, and then microchip inserted into a new robot. Furthermore, when it comes to reasoning about the perpetuity of the self, people tend to give special credence to episodic (or autobiographical) memories, such as remembering having had dinner In contrast to semantic memory, which involves general, factual knowledge that cannot be easily countenanced in terms of its acquisition, episodic memory involves autobiographical events that one can recall having personally experienced at a certain place and time Similar to aspects of the self that be derived from our own 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P9.52
personally experienced at a certain place and time Similar to aspects of the self that be derived from our own predictable behaviors (e.g., “I’m usually stubborn”), episodic memories also give shape to one’s core concept of the self. They feature a self-referential quality of retrieval (i.e., a sense of “mineness”), or the ability to mentally re-experience the event from a first-person perspective. This gives the individual a continued sense of ownership over the memory. Together, these qualities lend themselves to a sort of intuitive model, or default stance, of psychological continuity after death . For example, if one recalls the experience 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P9.72
sort of intuitive model, or default stance, of psychological continuity after death . For example, if one recalls the experience of having died and seeing the surgeons below attempting to resuscitate her physical body, that individual is likely to be convinced that it was indeed herself floating above the operating table, not someone else. Thus, for some people, such convincing episodic memories of having lived before or surviving death are the most powerful epistemological evidence of an afterlife, trumping materialist conjectures about the role of the brain in consciousness. If someone recalls having a memory of a personal event, he or 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P9.92
about the role of the brain in consciousness. If someone recalls having a memory of a personal event, he or she is likely to assume that they were, in fact, “present” at the time of encoding extant memory is the product of the self’s first-hand experiences at that point in time). The “seeing is believing” heuristic is hard to override when thinking about the self after death. C Physical Embodiment Parapsychological accounts of life after death reflect the implicit assumption that the same mind can inhabit different bodies (such as a physical and nonphysical one) at different periods of time, or 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P10.12
the same mind can inhabit different bodies (such as a physical and nonphysical one) at different periods of time, or even multiple bodies over a long, continuous period of time. This observation aligns with a major set of findings in the cognitive sciences showing that we perceive others as having an immutable personal identity that exists independently of their physical appearance. For example, young children judge a caterpillar that has become a butterfly, or a dog that has changed breed, as “the same individual” so long as their preferences are the same Yet these ideas are also constrained by our everyday 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P10.31
“the same individual” so long as their preferences are the same Yet these ideas are also constrained by our everyday social experiences. As previously noted, there are NDE accounts whereby people are met by deceased relatives, all of whom are identifiable even though they may appear quite different than what the experiencer remembers (they just know it’s that person). Presumably, what makes these decedents “recognizable” is that the person’s mind is essentially the same as it was in life. Although the afterlife is typically described as being populated by ethereal spirits (i.e., people without bodies), however, those who have had NDEs 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P10.5
afterlife is typically described as being populated by ethereal spirits (i.e., people without bodies), however, those who have had NDEs often betray their implicit representation of these souls as still possessing a bounded corporeal existence. These departed souls may be packaged in invisible bodies, but they would seem to be embodied nonetheless. Folk depictions of the dead endow them with literal, if altered, body forms. In addition, to exert pressure on objects in the natural environment so that their presence is detectable in the form of a communicative “sign,” as is the case in many parapsychological accounts, souls must occupy physical 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P10.7
detectable in the form of a communicative “sign,” as is the case in many parapsychological accounts, souls must occupy physical space and possess attributes (e.g., mass) While the concept of reincarnation endorsed in popular survival narratives includes the assumption that the person can be reborn into another, completely different, body, when physical similarities are present between the deceased and the living, this is seen as constituting strong evidence for the Most often, but not exclusively, these marks correspond with wounds that would have been inflicted at the time of death in a previous life. Congenital abnormalities such as missing fingers, rare 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P10.89
would have been inflicted at the time of death in a previous life. Congenital abnormalities such as missing fingers, rare birthmarks, and skin irregularities such as discoloration, lesions, spots, or moles are said to betray the cause of death or other misfortunes from the individual’s previous life. For example, Stevenson reports the case of a child who was born with a pale, scar-like tissue approximately three centimeters wide and extending around her entire skull. In conjunction with this unusual physical defect, the girl claimed to recall the life of a man who had had major skull surgery shortly before his 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P11.07
defect, the girl claimed to recall the life of a man who had had major skull surgery shortly before his death. Stevenson viewed such cases of combined past-life memories and physical markings as the best objective evidence of reincarnation. In fact, he devoted a major tome to these so-called “reincarnation and biology” subtypes in which he meticulously documented over 200 such Just like comparing the details of personal recollections to historical events, physical marks that correspond to those on the deceased (sometimes observable in autopsy photographs) are also taken as verification that some essential aspect of the individual (i.e., the “soul”) 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P11.25
(sometimes observable in autopsy photographs) are also taken as verification that some essential aspect of the individual (i.e., the “soul”) has returned to the human world through literal rebirth. Thus, when a person is reborn they are represented as possessing a bounded corporeal existence that shares some form of continuity with the person before death, and thus provides a convenient (and reliable) means of evidence that they are one and the same person. The appeal of using physical similarities as key indicators of a past life can be partly understood in light of inherent cognitive biases concerning our folk knowledge of 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P11.43
indicators of a past life can be partly understood in light of inherent cognitive biases concerning our folk knowledge of persons. Such features are convenient, unique, and easy to detect. In the natural world, too, we ascribe continued personal identity to individuals based on stable physical traits when appearance or personality is otherwise radically altered such as Alzheimer’s disease or amnesia, traumatic bodily injury, or as the result of dramatic aging over long periods of time Likewise, by comparing physical marks between the living and dead to ascertain the likelihood of reincarnation, whereby some essential and immortal aspect of the individual 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P11.61
between the living and dead to ascertain the likelihood of reincarnation, whereby some essential and immortal aspect of the individual is envisioned as remaining the same from one life to the next, parapsychologists are employing the same default empirical devices as those used in the everyday social world. Similarly, Cohen found that members of an Afro-Brazilian spirit possession cult tended to attribute blame to the possessed (i.e., living) person, rather than to the possessing spirit. For example, if a person were drunk at a street party and behaved in socially unacceptable ways, even though onlookers said the person was possessed by 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P11.79
drunk at a street party and behaved in socially unacceptable ways, even though onlookers said the person was possessed by a spirit who had displaced the individual’s mind, they still showed contempt towards the inebriate, and that person would often be Thus, people seem to find it difficult to disentangle physical appearance and personal identity and harbor an intuitive association between these categories. Again, in accepting a person’s claim to have lived before, parapsychologists are likely to revert to the standard cognitive heuristics that they deploy in everyday contexts, even though reincarnation entails, in principle, a transference of the soul to 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P11.96
cognitive heuristics that they deploy in everyday contexts, even though reincarnation entails, in principle, a transference of the soul to another form. Together, these observations suggest that one reason popular reports of NDEs and reincarnation are compelling is because they meet cognitively intuitive expectations about what counts as evidence for life after death. Their wide appeal suggests that they are not simply by-products of enculturation or indoctrination into a particular theology. Our position is that existing findings in the cognitive sciences, along with targeted additional research questions, can help scholars to pinpoint which psychological pressures drive the continuation of these popular 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P12.17
along with targeted additional research questions, can help scholars to pinpoint which psychological pressures drive the continuation of these popular ideas even in the face of widespread scepticism and a materialist scientific worldview. II Conclusion To explain why survival narratives have become popular in the modern west we thus need to take account of human cognition. This cognitive approach does not supplant or exclude explanations which look towards socio- cultural particulars that may give rise to them, but rather, complements them. It is rather obvious that to provide a compelling account of particular forms of life after death in a specific 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P12.39
It is rather obvious that to provide a compelling account of particular forms of life after death in a specific culture at a point in time, it is necessary to be concerned with broader socio-cultural factors. For instance, in addition to providing people with a conceptual framework for their inability to cognitively past-life reasoning also satisfies present emotional needs, accounting for challenges by appealing to some previously lived and unresolved traumatic event 2006; Meyersburg and McNally 2010; Partridge 2006; Spanos, et al., 1991; Just as explanatory accounts of the popularity of life after death accounts must take heed of the socio-cultural 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P12.6
al., 1991; Just as explanatory accounts of the popularity of life after death accounts must take heed of the socio-cultural contexts within which narratives are embedded, likewise, explanations of dominant cultural accounts must also recognize the importance of panhuman cognitive processes in shaping their success. We must look not only at mechanisms of indoctrination and simplistic notions of existential anxiety, but also at how such ideas articulate with an underlying cognitive system that works in predictable ways. Such ideas tap basic human cognitive processes, including simulation constraints imposed by consciously representing death as non-consciousness. Parapsychology, while ostensibly empirically motivated, may serve 	How to Know You’ve Survived Death: P12.81
human cognitive processes, including simulation constraints imposed by consciously representing death as non-consciousness. Parapsychology, while ostensibly empirically motivated, may serve similar purposes as religion in this natural, complementary sense. This is especially true for cognitive scientists of religion, since CSR offers a clear conceptual perspective from which to understand the seemingly impenetrable appeal of parapsychology. Belief in parapsychological phenomena (and yet who may not classify themselves as religious or even spiritual) may even be a better—and untapped—resource for ascertaining the role of cognitive mechanisms in this domain of human reasoning.

Objective: There are several existing questionnaires measuring paranormal or scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs but none give comprehensive cover of a broad spectrum of beliefs while also being up-to-date. There is also a debate about the number of separate types of belief. Thereby, reported here is the development and validation of a new multidimensional questionnaire measure of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in the general UK population. completed a questionnaire containing a pool of 82 items covering nine facets of belief discernible conceptually within the existing research literature. Scree analysis followed by exploratory factor 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P2.01
82 items covering nine facets of belief discernible conceptually within the existing research literature. Scree analysis followed by exploratory factor analysis indicated the existence of four empirically observable factors: belief in supernatural forces; belief in God and destiny; belief in alien visitation, monsters and conspiracies; and belief in consciousness beyond the body. Twenty-four items were selected as measures of these factors. Studies 2, 3 and 4 demonstrated the convergent and divergent validity of the four empirically-derived questionnaire subscales and their internal reliability. Conclusion. The resultant new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) is a psychometrically robust measure and comprises a 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P2.38
reliability. Conclusion. The resultant new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) is a psychometrically robust measure and comprises a comprehensive framework which can be used to systematically investigate the psychological and social concomitants of such beliefs. Introduction observed that around three-quarters of the adult American population accept at least one paranormal belief (for example, ghosts, telepathy, precognition, astrology) reported moderate levels of conspiracist ideation in their series of studies. Despite the prevalence of belief in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena there is currently no comprehensive and up-to-date measure available for researchers. The studies reported here document the development and validation of a 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P2.8
currently no comprehensive and up-to-date measure available for researchers. The studies reported here document the development and validation of a comprehensive and multi-dimensional measure of scientifically unsubstantiated belief to assist research examining the causes and consequences of such belief. This definition emphasises the lack of empirical evidence for a belief and so might include those in conspiracy theories and religious belief, though these are not typically regarded as facets of the paranormal. The present series of studies uses the term `scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena\' as a generic one to encompass a wider field than is commonly understood by the word `paranormal\'.

Belief in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena may seem harmless but can have damaging impacts on personal outcomes and on wider society. For example, a tendency to conspiracist thinking is associated with non-compliance with health care for HIV/AIDS while belief in demonic possession can result in violence against individuals perceived to be afflicted ( This may be of concern in politicians who take decisions with far-reaching consequences, such as whether to fund renewable energy sources or homeopathy delivered through a national health service.

outdated, for example, the statement `witches do exist\' could be argued to be true since people who follow the practice of Wicca call themselves witches. The item `There is life on other planets\' is now scientifically supported and accepted as the case. The items in the traditional religious belief scale are Judeo-Christian in nature and do not address the full spectrum of traditional religious beliefs commonplace in many countries today.

Its scope, however, does not cover the full range of popular paranormal belief. measures general conspiracist ideation, the tendency to endorse conspiracy theories across a range of domains. Its scope is thus limited to one specific facet of scientifically unsubstantiated belief.

existing measures cover the whole range of common beliefs in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena. The present study aimed to identity the conceptually and empirically discriminable components of scientifically unsubstantiated belief and to create a multi-dimensional questionnaire measuring belief across a wide range of topics of current concern and using items that are well-understood by the general population. In Study 1, participants were presented with 82 questions covering a wide range of beliefs including the seven facets of the RPBS and additionally belief in conspiracy theories, religion, destiny / fate / karma, and alternative medicine. 6 In addition, Study 4 examined how mortality 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P6.04

An opportunity sampling method was employed wherein the researchers used their electronic networks to elicit the input of respondents. Undergraduate students were approached via email, as well as individuals in social networks on Facebook and Instagram.

consideration of other areas of belief, specifically belief in the influence of destiny / fate / karma and belief in the efficacy of alternative medicine. We took a deliberately inclusive approach in order to produce a wide-ranging measure, and this included items measuring religious belief. Nine conceptual domains of belief were identified: anomalous mental powers including clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, and psychokinesis, an example of an item being `some people can see events before they happen\'; traditional supernatural belief including good and bad luck, dowsing, and casting spells, an exemplar item being `touching wood can bring good luck\'; fate / destiny / 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P7.02
bad luck, dowsing, and casting spells, an exemplar item being `touching wood can bring good luck\'; fate / destiny / karma, e.g., `some events are fated to occur\'; extraordinary life forms including aliens, the Loch Ness monster, and Bigfoot, e.g., `Aliens from other planets have visited Earth\'; the survival hypothesis 8 including reincarnation, ghosts, and astral travel, e.g., `Some part of a person’s consciousness can survive their death\'; future prediction, e.g., `Study of the stars can be used to predict the future for individuals\'; Energy-based therapies, e.g., \'homeopathy is an effective form of medicine\'; religious beliefs, e.g. \'The world was created 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P7.5

For each of these nine conceptual domains of belief items were generated so that collectively the item pool comprised of 82 in all. The 82 items were scored on a scale of 1-5, where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.

Loadings of each item onto the factors are displayed in Table 1. 9 The factor analysis showed only 11 items of 82 that loaded above 0.4 onto two factors, and no items that loaded above 0.4 onto more than two factors.

1 HERE By rank ordering the items within each factor in terms of the magnitude of the item loading, an inspection of the content of the items for each factor led to the following names for each of the four factors being specified: belief in supernatural forces (BSF) belief in the influence of God and destiny (BIGD), belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies (BAMC) - the lead item being `There is no physical evidence on earth of alien visitors from other planets\' (reverse scored) and, belief in consciousness beyond the body (BCB), the lead item being `Individual existence ends with death\' 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P9.42

This may be because the RPBS did not examine this belief directly; the items in the RPBS spirituality facet relate to astral travel, reincarnation, and communication with the dead, which may imply, but do not specifically state, the possibility of consciousness existing outside the body. The BCB factor appears more focused than the other factors, but this is what the results indicated so this would appear to be a genuine factor derived from a large sample. .

so this would appear to be a genuine factor derived from a large sample. . The Australian Sheep-Goat Scale maps conceptually onto both the BSF and BCB scales, though the ASGS has only a single scale. This is possibly because the ASGS contains only two items pertinent to the belief in consciousness beyond the body (addressing life after death) and this may be too narrow in scope to be apparent as a distinct factor.

2 was to investigate the convergent and discriminant validity of the new MQSUB. Convergent validity would be supported by the observation of substantive correlations between the subscales of the MQSUB and existing questionnaires with equivalent or overlapping conceptual content, while divergent validity would be supported by the observation of smaller correlations elsewhere. The following correlations were predicted on the basis of conceptual overlap and similarity of content between the MQSUB and other measures: belief in supernatural forces (BSF) should correlate substantively with almost all facets of the RPBS, since the facets all suppose the existence of forces beyond the natural world; 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P11.34
with almost all facets of the RPBS, since the facets all suppose the existence of forces beyond the natural world; the exception is Traditional Religious belief, which is often characterised somewhat differently to other forms of scientifically unsubstantiated belief; belief in the influence of God and destiny (BIGD) should correlate substantively with the Traditional Religion facet of the RPBS; BIGD should also correlate strongly with the Precognition facet, which presupposes the existence of a force, conceptually similar to destiny, controlling future events; belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies (BAMC) should correlate substantively with the Extraordinary Life Forms facet of the RPBS 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P11.82
events; belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies (BAMC) should correlate substantively with the Extraordinary Life Forms facet of the RPBS and with the GCBS since these purpose to measure the same concepts; and, belief in consciousness beyond the body (BCB) should correlate substantively with the Traditional Religion and Spiritualism facets of the RPBS, which depend on some form of soul, or mind that is not tied to the body. 12 Method Participants There were 123 participants, a subset of those recruited to study 1.

the elderly, those not in relationships, the unemployed, those with lower income, those with poorer education, and among minority ethnic groups. The absence of any relationship between the subscales of the MQSUB and demographic factors including age, marital status, ethnicity, employment status, and income, argues against the Social Marginality Hypothesis as operationalised by simple demographics measures. A more nuanced view of social marginality therefore was examined in Study 4. In summary, the convergent validity of the MQSUB is attested to by the strong correlations between the subscales of the MQSUB and the scores on existing questionnaires with conceptually similar or overlapping 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P17.1
the strong correlations between the subscales of the MQSUB and the scores on existing questionnaires with conceptually similar or overlapping content. Divergent validity is supported by less substantive correlations where there is less conceptual similarity between the scales examined. Study 3 The aim of Study 3 was to continue the investigation of the convergent and discriminant validity of the new MQSUB. Convergent validity would be supported by a substantive correlation between the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale and the BSF subscale which has overlapping conceptual content, and a moderate correlation with the BCB subscale which has some overlapping content in so far as 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P17.58
overlapping conceptual content, and a moderate correlation with the BCB subscale which has some overlapping content in so far as it assumes the existence of some aspect of soul or mind that can exist outside the body. 18 Correlations were predicted as follows: BSF should correlate substantively with the ASGS; BCB should correlate moderately with the ASGS; MQSUBs subscales correlate moderately with REI Experiential thinking; and, small correlations of MQSUBs subscales with REI Rational thinking.

Bivariate correlations among the variables are also shown in Table 3.1. INSERT TABLE 3.1 HERE 21 Scores on the ASGS were correlated strongly with BSF, and moderately with BCB, as predicted. There were also small correlations with BIGD and BAMC, which were not specifically predicted but unsurprising given the tendency for correlations among subscales of belief.

As predicted, there was a positive correlation between the intuitive scale of the REI and all subscales of the MQSUB, and a smaller negative correlation that reached statistical significance only for BSF and BIGD with the rational scale of the REI. The correlations among the subscales of the MQSUB were smaller in Study 3, ranging from 0.06 to 0.48, than in Study 2 where they ranged from 0.37 to 0.56.

Statistically significant bivariate correlates (with the exception of ASGS scores) of the four MQSUB subscales were entered into four regression analyses wherein in turn each MQSUB subscale was designated as the dependent variable.

The observation of lower levels of BIGD in white Europeans compared to other ethnicities is perhaps to be expected given increasing secularisation in the countries of the European Union.

Study 4 self-perceived marginalisation was predicted to be related to scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs, though only 24 weakly. A larger correlation should be observed between self-perceived marginalisation and belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies, following consistent observations that social anomie predicts conspiracist thinking.

Reactive rebelliousness was predicted to relate to belief in scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in general, and in particular to a belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies via the link with a sense of alienation.

Measures which has three subscales measuring internality (the belief that there is a contingent relationship between actions and outcomes, an example item being `I can pretty much determine what will happen in my life\'), belief in the influence of powerful others as determinants of outcomes (an example item being `I feel like what happens in my life is mostly determined by powerful people\'), and belief in the role of chance as a determinant of outcomes (an example item being `to a great extent my life is 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P25.07
the role of chance as a determinant of outcomes (an example item being `to a great extent my life is controlled by accidental happenings\'); which measures five forms of such awareness (fearfulness, acceptance, disempowerment, disengagement, and mortality legacy awareness), which measures proactive and reactive rebelliousness, an exemplar item being `How often do you do something you shouldn\'t just to get some excitement?\'; and a section containing demographic questions. Procedure The procedure was similar to Studies 2 and 3, with identical inclusion criteria applying. Results and Discussion There were no missing data. There were no cases where a participant had selected the 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P25.58
criteria applying. Results and Discussion There were no missing data. There were no cases where a participant had selected the same response option for all (or nearly all) items, and so all were included in the analysis. All participants were included in the analysis. Given an additional new measure was included in this study, a brief, twelve item, self-report measure of Self-Perceived Marginalisation as devised by the second author, the results of a one-factor principal components analysis of these items is shown in Table 4.1. An initial scree analysis indicated a single factor solution, with 43% variance explained and Cronbach\'s 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P26.06
is shown in Table 4.1. An initial scree analysis indicated a single factor solution, with 43% variance explained and Cronbach\'s Alpha=0.88, indicating good internal reliability. All twelve items load substantively onto the factor at above 0.5, with the lead item being item 8: I think that I am someone who exists on the margins of society. INSERT TABLE 4.1 HERE The score on the ASGS was calculated as the sum of the items. Means and standard deviations of the scales and facets are shown in Table 4.2.

INSERT TABLE 4.2 HERE Statistically significant bivariate correlates (with the exception of ASGS scores) of the four MQSUB subscales were entered into four regression analyses wherein in turn each MQSUB 27 subscale was designated as the dependent variable.

magnitude of correlations among the four factors of the MQSUBs is similar to that in Study 2 and 3, thereby providing replication. ASGS was substantively correlated with BSF, replicating the findings of Study 3, as predicted from the overlap in terms of the conceptual content of the items. It can be seen that various forms of mortality awareness are independently related with three of the MSQUB subscales, with scores on the BAMC subscale, beliefs in aliens, monsters and conspiracies, being the exception. Notably, mortality disengagement is inversely related to beliefs in God and destiny, with higher scores on BIGD covarying with 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P27.22
exception. Notably, mortality disengagement is inversely related to beliefs in God and destiny, with higher scores on BIGD covarying with lower mortality disengagement, thereby suggesting that beliefs in deities and fate is associated with an enhanced ability to not avoid (or engage with) the fact of one\'s eventual demise. In addition, mortality disempowerment was seen to be independently and negatively related to beliefs in consciousness 28 beyond the body. Consistent with this was the finding that self-perceived marginalisation (also about a sense of disempowerment) likewise predicted scores on this form of scientifically unsubstantiated belief, albeit that bivariately such self-perceptions were correlated 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P27.6
sense of disempowerment) likewise predicted scores on this form of scientifically unsubstantiated belief, albeit that bivariately such self-perceptions were correlated with all four MSQUB subscale scores. However, mortality disempowerment was negatively related to BCB and marginalisation was positively related to BCB. It is possible that self-perceived marginalisation promotes a need for belief, and then the chosen area of belief satisfies a more specific and focused area of need. Further, mortality acceptance (inversely) and mortality legacy (positively) were both found to be independently related to BSF (belief in supernatural forces), though in different directions: people who do not have a sense of 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P27.99
independently related to BSF (belief in supernatural forces), though in different directions: people who do not have a sense of mortality acceptance are more likely to believe in supernatural forces; whilst those who have a heightened sense of mortality legacy, of wanting to leave something behind after death, are more likely to believe in supernatural forces, Arguably, however, both of these forms of mortality awareness (high legacy and low acceptance) are about a non-acceptance of death; covariance with belief in supernatural forces that likewise transcend death is consistent thereby with such an orientation. General Discussion The new Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P28.37
forces that likewise transcend death is consistent thereby with such an orientation. General Discussion The new Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) consists of four subscales measuring belief in a broad range of phenomena. Beliefs in this area have been assumed to be organised into several factors, but with disagreement about the number of components. This study clarifies the nature and number of the factors by starting from a broad range of conceptual possibilities. The first subscale measures belief in supernatural forces (BSF), including traditional superstitions, future prediction, energy healing, ghosts, and telepathy. The second subscale 29 measures belief in 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P28.76
supernatural forces (BSF), including traditional superstitions, future prediction, energy healing, ghosts, and telepathy. The second subscale 29 measures belief in the influence of God and destiny (BIGD) including traditional religious concepts (creation, rules for moral behaviour, and life after death) and the inescapable influence of fate or destiny. The third subscale measures belief in aliens, monsters and conspiracies (BAMC) with items addressing alien visitation and the Loch Ness monster, and popular conspiracies, for example national governments routinely lying to the general public and pharmaceutical companies withholding cures. The fourth and final subscale measures belief that a conscious existence can continue independent 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P29.15
public and pharmaceutical companies withholding cures. The fourth and final subscale measures belief that a conscious existence can continue independent of the body (BCB; belief in consciousness beyond the body). The four subscales correlate with each other at small to moderate levels of association, confirming their relative independence and yet at the same time consistent with observations from previous research that belief in distinct types of scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena tend to co-occur. The new MQSUB represents an advance on previous questionnaire measures by including an expanded conceptual repertoire as covered by its four dimensions within a focused and that all of 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P29.53
measures by including an expanded conceptual repertoire as covered by its four dimensions within a focused and that all of these items combine into a single component which they termed new-age philosophy. The other three dimensions have not been so clearly apparent in previous measures that did not include items covering aspects of them. The BAMC dimension combines three facets of belief: alien visitation, monsters, and conspiracies, into a single factor that seems to address the belief that there is knowledge kept hidden from the public. The BIGD combines these two aspects of belief into one dimension, not explicit in previous 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P29.92
kept hidden from the public. The BIGD combines these two aspects of belief into one dimension, not explicit in previous measures that did not tap into both of these elements. The belief in consciousness existing beyond the body is now a well-focused, explicit belief, not subsumed into other more specific areas of belief (such as ghosts, or astral travel). This contrasts with the absence of statistically significant multivariate relationships with the demographic proxy indicators of marginalisation such as educational status and household income, and with the absence even of simple bivariate relationships for most of the demographic variables in Study 2 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P30.34
household income, and with the absence even of simple bivariate relationships for most of the demographic variables in Study 2 and 3. Such demographic factors however, may not be good indicators of the more subjective aspects of self-perceived marginalisation, whereas the individual’s perception of their status and influence in society would appear to be more pertinent to their individual beliefs. Previous observations of gender differences were not repeated here with the exception of BSF in Study 2 and Study 4, with this difference disappearing in Study 2 when fantasy-proneness 31 Another possibility is that gender differences are not based on 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P30.78

Therefore, mortality salience appears to have more general effect on beliefs, not confined to the scientifically unsubstantiated. Future research needs to take account of the complexity of the nature of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P31.21
the scientifically unsubstantiated. Future research needs to take account of the complexity of the nature of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in order for consistency of findings across studies to emerge. Studies 2, 3, and 4 have illustrated that distinct subscales of belief have different relationships with other psychological variables. No simple understanding can be reached for relationships between, for example, mortality awareness, marginalisation, rebelliousness, fantasy proneness, thinking style, or conspiracist thinking, and scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs without considering the nature of the belief. Investigations of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs should have sufficient scope in order to ensure that appropriate questions are asked. Too narrow 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P31.65
Investigations of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs should have sufficient scope in order to ensure that appropriate questions are asked. Too narrow a frame of reference can result 32 in apparent relationships that may not align precisely with underlying psychological constructs. For example, gender differences may be due to differences in the level of fantasy proneness and not gender per se, and marginalisation as a covariate has not been apparent in the past using simple demographic measures but was evident in Study 4 where questions focused upon self-perceived marginalisation. This underscores the importance of measuring psychological variables appropriately. to ascertain to what extent 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P32.08

Future research needs to examine how well the factor structure translates across cultures. There may be broad agreement regarding the factors, but with some specific items of belief aligning in different relation to the factors.

Supernatural Forces factor in conjunction with belief in superstitions and future prediction, but in other cultures with a different tradition (for example, Hinduism) astrology might be an element of religious belief. Other research could examine whether the relationship between beliefs and other psychological concepts may vary under different religious traditions. For example, mortality awareness may prompt different kinds of belief in different spiritual contexts. Locus of control may not relate to belief in the same way in collectivistic cultures, where one’s life options are 33 more constrained by societal expectations, and hence locus of control is less internal, as compared with 	Multi-dimensional unsubstantiated belief: P32.96

Future experiments could manipulate mortality awareness or stress to examine the effect on scores on the subscales of scientifically unsubstantiated belief. In conclusion, the new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) offers a concise but conceptually broad ranging measure with good psychometric properties.

present study was designed to assess whether the relationship between narcissistic personality and paranormal belief identified by Tobacyk and Mitchell earlier could be replicated with a general population and to see whether the effect could be found with a narrower definition of paranormal beliefs that focuses only on belief in psychic phenomena. 75 participants completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and two measures of paranormal belief, the Paranormal Belief Scale and the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale. There was no correlation between narcissism and Paranormal Belief Scale scores, but narcissism and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores were significantly positively correlated. Of the three subscales to the Australian Sheep-Goat measure, scores for narcissism correlated with belief in ESP and PK but not in Life after death. These relationships were interpreted in terms of need for control. 	Narcissism and belief in the paranormal - Abstract: P0.01

magnetic stimulation (TMS) with weak (micro Tesla) with a sham-field control group. Personality characteristics indicating suggestibility (absorption, signs of abnormal temporal lobe activity, and a “new age”-life-style orientation) were used as predictors. Sensed presence, mystical, and other somatosensory experiences previously reported from the magnetic field stimulation were outcome measures. We found no evidence for any effects of the magnetic fields, neither in the entire group, nor in individuals high in suggestibility. Because the personality characteristics significantly predicted outcomes, suggestibility may account for previously reported effects. Our results strongly question the earlier claims of experiential effects of weak magnetic fields.

it is difficult to find a natural explanation as to why a surprising coincidence occurs. In attempting to find one, people may be inclined to accept paranormal explanations. The objective of this study was to investigate whether people with a lower threshold for being surprised by coincidences have a greater propensity to become believers compared to those with a higher threshold. Participants were exposed to artificial coincidences, which were formally defined as less or more probable, and were asked to provide remarkability ratings. Paranormal belief was measured by the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale. An analysis of the remarkability ratings revealed a significant interaction effect between Sheep-Goat score and type of coincidence, suggesting that people with lower thresholds of surprise, when experiencing coincidences, harbor higher paranormal belief than those with a higher threshold. The theoretical aspects of these findings were discussed. 	Sensitivity to coincidences and paranormal belief - Abstract: P0.01
Transliminality is ‘‘a hypothesized tendency for psychological material to cross thresholds into or out of consciousness,’’ which has been proposed to derive from hyperconnectivity between temporal-limbic structures and sensory association cortices. Accordingly, it might be expected that transliminality would positively correlate with temporal lobe lability. To test this hypothesis, 135 undergraduate psychology students at an Australian and a British university completed the Revised Transliminality Scale a validated measure of temporal lobe lability. As predicted, scores on transliminality showed a strong association with the general temporal lobe as well as moderate correlations 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1964
lability. As predicted, scores on transliminality showed a strong association with the general temporal lobe as well as moderate correlations with a number of other scalar variables and individual items. The findings are consistent with the idea that transliminality is related to more ungated processing related to temporal lobe functioning, and furthermore that temporal lobe phenomenology promotes transliminal experiences with mystical or religious overtones. # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

concept of transliminality was previously described in this journal as ‘‘. . .a hypothesised tendency for psychological material to cross (trans) thresholds (limines) into or out of consciousness’’ . This definition derives from the finding of a single dimension that underlies seven psychological variables: magical ideation, mystical experience, absorption, hyperesthesia, manic experience, dream interpretation, and fantasy proneness. As a result, the phrase ‘‘psychological material’’ is intended to cover a wide range of imagery, ideation, affect and perception. At first this psychological material was thought to flow from the subliminal but later research suggested a flow in the opposite direction and even from 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1964.72
was thought to flow from the subliminal but later research suggested a flow in the opposite direction and even from the external environment to the supraliminal consciousness . Thus, the concept of transliminality as for a comprehensive review of the previous research on transliminality, but since that review a good deal of research has been published. Therefore, we review some of this literature next since the progression of the recent studies on transliminality nicely illustrates the rationale for expecting a positive relationship between transliminality and temporal lobe lability. One of the most important pieces of research on the transliminality construct was published 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1965.06

One of the most important pieces of research on the transliminality construct was published in The 29-item true/ was subjected to a process of ‘‘top-down purification.’’ combined with tests in an iterative fashion. In other words, the top-down purification approach aims to create a reliable and undimensional interval measure of a latent variable that has a known fit to the Rasch The result is that the original 29-item scale is administered to provide context, but only 17 items are scored The following studies are mostly based on this new 17-item Revised Transliminality Scale, which is being 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1965.26
17 items are scored The following studies are mostly based on this new 17-item Revised Transliminality Scale, which is being increasingly used in research and should be the only scoring scheme used in future work due to its psychometric superiority. The Transliminality Scale shows particularly strong correlations with paranormal belief and used two scales derived from the work of Kumar and Pekala the ‘‘Encounters’’ subscale, which deals with alleged encounters the ‘‘Poltergeist’’ subscale, whose a single item on apparitions. For a first-year student sample the Revised Transliminality Scale correlated 0.61 with the Encounters subscale, 0.51 with the Poltergeist subscale, and 0.38 with 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1965.46
student sample the Revised Transliminality Scale correlated 0.61 with the Encounters subscale, 0.51 with the Poltergeist subscale, and 0.38 with seeing a ghost, all significant at P<0.001. In that article a psychophysiological explanation of transliminality was adumbrated (and modified to a state-trait construct where transliminality is thought to be mediated by intense This initial psychophysiological description of transliminality identified the limbic system as providing source material for phenomena such as apparitional and visionary experiences. This proposal strongly paralleled Persinger’s longstanding hypothesis that experiences of sensed presences, apparitions, and mystical experiences Thalbourne, expanded upon the suggestions by Houran and and speculated that a 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1965.66
experiences of sensed presences, apparitions, and mystical experiences Thalbourne, expanded upon the suggestions by Houran and and speculated that a much greater degree of ‘‘interconnectedness’’ or ‘‘fluidity’’ was present in the brains of highly transliminal persons. Specifically, the items that comprised the Revised Transliminality Scale suggested a hyperconnectivity between temporallimbic structures and sensory association cortices. This view predicts that those with theoretically greater levels of transliminality will experience perceptual anomalies. For example, synæsthesia has been described as the situation where ‘‘an inducing stimulus produces, at the same time, two kinds of sensory response: the primary sensory experience that is normally associated with 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1965.86
stimulus produces, at the same time, two kinds of sensory response: the primary sensory experience that is normally associated with that stimulus and, anomalously, a secondary experience Likewise, noted that synæsthesia probably reflects heightened connectivity between adjacent cerebral regions. Therefore, synæsthesia is a theoretical consequence of enhanced transliminality. tested this hypothesis in two correlational studies. The first study involved 115 persons from the Australian general population who had taken part in the study of Transliminality was here measured by a factor score, and synæsthesia by Tellegen’s seven-item scale. The Spearman rank correlation between scores on transliminality and synæsthesia was a highly significant 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1966.06
and synæsthesia by Tellegen’s seven-item scale. The Spearman rank correlation between scores on transliminality and synæsthesia was a highly significant 0.47. The second study used 242 psychology The rank order correlation between scores on transliminality and synæsthesia was also a highly significant 0.57. Notwithstanding these results, profound synæsthesia is a rare condition Thus, a collaborative effort is in progress between researchers in Zu¨ rich and the United States in which a sample of extreme, laboratory-validated synæsthetes will be compared to a control group on the Revised Transliminality Scale. There is stronger reason to believe that temporal lobe lability contributes to transliminality. noted 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1966.24
group on the Revised Transliminality Scale. There is stronger reason to believe that temporal lobe lability contributes to transliminality. noted that the temporal lobes, which constitute 40% of the cerebrum, are well situated for their major physiologic function of integrating polymodal perceptual inputs of all kinds, including those from the. . .sense organs. For example, smell, balance, hearing, and taste are processed by temporolimbic structures; and vision,. . .touch, position sense, and pain by neighboring areas. In addition the temporal lobes are responsible for interpreting various aspects of affective, conative, and cognitive functions such as memory, learning, language interpretation, and sense of 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1966.42
responsible for interpreting various aspects of affective, conative, and cognitive functions such as memory, learning, language interpretation, and sense of self. . .Thus, complex symptomatology results from firing within a temporal lobe or non-functional atrophic lesions of parts of a temporal lobe. If transliminality is an index of the degree of neurological interconnectedness, including more functional connections both within the temporal lobes and with other areas of the brain, then we should expect scores on transliminality to correlate with direct and indirect indicators of temporal lobe symptomatology.

Michael Persinger has argued that such temporal lobe symptomatology and He devised the Personal Philosophy to measure a postulated continuum of temporal lobe lability noted, ‘‘There are already construct validity [data] for Persinger’s temporal lobe scale; normal people who report more subjective experiences similar to those stated by patients whose deep temporal lobes are stimulated surgically show enhanced EEG lability within the temporal lobes but not the occipital lobes .’’ Accordingly, we predict that scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale correlate positively with measures of temporal lobe lability and with aspects of its symptomatology. We administered two 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1966.78

One instrument was the 29-item truefalse revised and scored according to Lange et al.’s Rasch scheme. In this implementation only 17 items are scored, which subsequently constitute a unidimensional scale with good reliability and an interval scale of measurement.

Note that all clusters were divided by the number of statements in them and multiplied by 100 so that the score of each participant could range from 0 to 100. 2.2. Descriptive statistics Table 1 shows the range of scores and the mean and standard deviation for each of the measures.

We should first note that transliminality correlated significantly though at a low level with and therefore an adjustment was made to two of the highest correlations, using the technique of partial correlation. The partial correlation for the correlation between transliminality and the general temporal lobe epilepsy scale decreased minimally from 0.72 to 0.70, while the partial correlation between transliminality and all signs involving temporal lobe factors likewise showed a minor decrease from 0.70 to 0.68. These changes suggest that acquiescence response bias had a negligible effect on the relevant correlations. As predicted, scores 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1967.96

As predicted, scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale were positively and significantly correlated with the general temporal lobe epilepsy scale, number of complex partial epileptic signs (which is a part of the former), all signs involving temporal lobe factors, sense of presence, liberal (exotic) beliefs, depersonalisation, auditory-vestibular experiences, visual images, paranormal experiences, hypomania, intense meaning, olfactory experiences, perseveration, hypergraphia, rare (potentially psychotic-like) features, limbic motor processes, acquiescence response bias, and conservative religious beliefs.

However, scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale did not significantly correlate with the lie scale, fear or phobia, egocentrism, automatic behaviours or suggestibility. 3.2. Correlational data for the Personal Philosophy Inventory items There are 140 items in the Personal Philosophy Inventory, and in order to ascertain which of them were related to transliminality two-tailed Pearson correlations were computed between the Revised Transliminality Scale and each of the 140 items. Fifty-five correlations were significant at the 0.05 level or less. To control for Type I error, attention was focused on those 28 correlations that were 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1968.83

The wording of the relevant items and their correlation coefficients are given in Table 3. A common theme appears amongst many if not most of the items in Table 3, which we tentatively identify as ‘‘spirituality’’. Even the items concerning physical symptoms might be thought to be a part of the psychophysiological syndrome known in the East as ‘‘kundalini’’, which is Moreover, it is already known that transliminality is associated with non-sectarian religiosity 4.

Discussion The robust pattern of findings clearly supports our hypothesis that transliminality involves aspects of temporal lobe lability. In particular, scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale significantly correlated with 17 clusters and 55 single items from the Personal Philosophy Inventory. Of the clusters, highly transliminal participants tended to experience a sense of presence [conceptually replicating the findings of Houran and Thalbourne 137.

As the primary seat of a rich complex of memory and fantasy, the temporal lobe has been hypothesized to instigate physiological experiences reminiscent of a One persistent observation is the propensity for temporal lobe experiences to be permeated by vague references to death and religious themes; they occur in both nonparanormal and paranormal contexts. Indeed, it has long been known that temporal lobe epileptics are characterized by their obsession with religiosity and morbid themes Accordingly, it is not surprising that 28 out of the 55 single items from the Personal Philosophy Inventory 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1971.1
morbid themes Accordingly, it is not surprising that 28 out of the 55 single items from the Personal Philosophy Inventory that correlated with scores on the Revised Transliminality Scale concern themes related to ‘‘spirituality.’’ For example, highly transliminal individuals in the study tended to have learned to meditate. It would be interesting to know whether high transliminals are prone to taking up meditation, or whether meditation tends to make a person more transliminal by encouraging The direction of cause and effect is unclear here. Certainly there is evidence that highly transliminal persons are more likely to be introspective , so these findings 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1971.32
unclear here. Certainly there is evidence that highly transliminal persons are more likely to be introspective , so these findings appear consistent. Transliminal experiences with religious or spiritual themes might be expected to generally elicit happy or elevated states. However, profound depressive states also seem possible in light of the fact that temporal lobe symptomatology can promote experiences with morbid themes. It was initially thought that a high level of transliminality is a psychologically uncomfortable condition— a distinctive state of consciousness in which the individual is relentlessly bombarded with internal and external stimuli. Because of this, high transliminals might turn to illicit 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1971.54
which the individual is relentlessly bombarded with internal and external stimuli. Because of this, high transliminals might turn to illicit substance use The present results suggest an alternative hypothesis. In some cases, it might be neither the amount of psychological material crossing thresholds into or out of consciousness nor poor coping abilities of high transliminals which promote a negative transliminal state. Instead, the degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness of a transliminal experience may be due in part to the themes that accompany the transliminal stimuli via temporal lobe symptomatology—and in this 	Temporal lobe lability in the highly transliminal mind: P1971.76
research has suggested that a number of environmental factors may be associated with a tendency for susceptible individuals to report mildly anomalous sensations typically associated with ‘‘haunted’’ locations, including a sense of presence, feeling dizzy, inexplicable smells, and so on. Factors that may be associated with such sensations include fluctuations in the electromagnetic field (EMF) and the presence of infrasound.

The second was the Australian Sheep–Goat Scale, a widely used measure of belief in and experience of the paranormal. The third was Persinger’s Personal Philosophy Inventory, although only the items that constitute the Temporal Lobe Signs (TLS) Inventory sub-scale were scored.

(TLS) Inventory sub-scale were scored. These items deal with psychological experiences typically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy but normally distributed throughout the general population. Although many participants reported anomalous sensations of various kinds, the number reported was unrelated to experimental condition but was related to TLS scores. The most parsimonious explanation for our findings is in terms of suggestibility. A recent poll by the Gallup Organization showed that 37% of A previous poll of British adults by MORI showed that 40% believed in ghosts and, of these, 37% claimed to have personally experienced Clearly, personal experience plays a large part 	The Haunt Project: P0.8
40% believed in ghosts and, of these, 37% claimed to have personally experienced Clearly, personal experience plays a large part in producing belief in ghosts and haunted locations, but how are we to explain such experiences? A number People can often come to believe that their house or workplace is haunted following an initial unusual experience that seems to them only to be explicable in paranormal terms.

Tandy and Lawrence suggest a number of obscure non-paranormal causes of ostensible ghostly activity including ‘‘water hammer in pipes and radiators (noises), electrical faults (fires, phone calls, video problems), structural faults (draughts, cold spots, damp spots, noises), seismic activity (object movement/destruction, noises) [.] and exotic organic phenomena (rats scratching, beetles ticking)’’.

(and the paranormal in general) all play a part in determining whether or not a particular location will be perceived as being haunted (and by whom). For example, Lange and asked two groups of participants to walk around a disused cinema and to note whether they experienced any cognitive, physiological, emotional, psychic, and spiritual responses in reaction to their surroundings. Half of the participants were simply told that the property was currently being renovated whereas the other half was told that paranormal activity had been reported there.

that paranormal activity had been reported there. As predicted, the latter participants reported significantly more physical, emotional, psychic, and spiritual experiences than those in collected data from 678 participants walking around Hampton Court Palace, reported to be one of the most haunted locations in England. Those who believed in ghosts reported more unusual experiences as they walked around than did non-believers and they were also more likely to attribute these experiences to ghostly intervention.

environmental factors associated with particular locations may be directly causing susceptible individuals to experience anomalous point out that the anomalous sensations typically associated with haunted locations include a diverse range of phenomena from fairly mild experiences, such as perceived sudden changes in temperature, unusual odours, and a sense of presence, up to full-blown apparitions. Such phenomena, it has been suggested, may be induced in some people by exposure to unusual geomagnetic and electromagnetic fields (EMF) Such unusual fields could have a number of causes including the natural variability in the Earth’s field, movements of tectonic plates against each other, local geological 	The Haunt Project: P1.39
number of causes including the natural variability in the Earth’s field, movements of tectonic plates against each other, local geological factors such as quartz-based rock and magnetic mineral properties, and man-made electrical The first line of evidence to support this notion comes from a number of studies that have measured the EMFs in reputedly haunted locations. EMFs at any specific location constantly vary both spatially and temporally.

Furthermore, Braithwaite emphasizes the need for simultaneous recordings from both target and baseline control sites in order to eliminate the possibility that a time-based difference is misinterpreted as a spatial difference.

it is possible, for example, that anomalous fields were occurring at both sites during the first recording and neither during the second. If the first recording was at the ‘‘haunted’’ site, investigators might erroneously conclude that they have further evidence for the EMF hypothesis. Braithwaite provides evidence from his own study, using simultaneous recordings from haunted and nearby baseline areas, that the magnetic field was indeed unusual at the former whilst simultaneously no unusual fields were recorded at the latter but such studies are rare to date. The idea that field complexity may be more important than overall ambient field strength 	The Haunt Project: P1.76
such studies are rare to date. The idea that field complexity may be more important than overall ambient field strength in inducing such experiences is supported by a further line of evidence, that is, results from laboratory-based studies. Across a series of studies, Persinger and colleagues claimto have induced anomalous experiences, including in one case that of a full-blown apparition , by exposing the temporal lobes of the brain to transcerebral complex magnetic fields. It is claimed that such effects are particularly likely in participants with labile temporal lobes who will tend to score highly on Makarec Temporal Lobe Signs 	The Haunt Project: P1.85

For reported that six out of eight participants with high scores on the TLS felt a presence upon being exposed to transcerebral complex magnetic fields, whereas none of their eight low-scoring participants did. The exact mechanism whereby exposure of the temporal lobes to complex magnetic fields could cause anomalous experiences in susceptible individuals is not yet clear. argues that the fact that such effects only seem to occur in the laboratory after prolonged exposure suggests that ‘‘the mechanism of 	The Haunt Project: P1.94
the fact that such effects only seem to occur in the laboratory after prolonged exposure suggests that ‘‘the mechanism of interaction is a subtle one perhaps at the level of psychopharmacological effects between synapses of neurons or increased hyperpolarisation of specific inhibitory neuronal systems.’’ The consequences of such effects might be neuronal disinhibition producing altered mental states and hallucinations. Unfortunately, until very recently there had been no attempt by independent investigators to replicate Persinger’s research using transcerebral complex magnetic fields.

comparing the effects of transcerebral complex magnetic fields with shamfields. They found no evidence that magnetic fields induced sensed presence, mystical, or other somatosensory experiences, but personality measures such as absorption, TLS scores, and orientation towards a new-age lifestyle did predict the occurrence of such experiences. They therefore argued that the effects previously reported by Persinger Persinger and may well be nothing more than the effects of suggestibility manifesting themselves in experiments with inadequate use of doubleblind have robustly rejected such criticism, claiming that their work does make use of adequate double-blind procedures and pointing out what they felt were 	The Haunt Project: P2.12

Clearly, further research is urgently needed in this potentially fruitful, if controversial, area.

Amongst their criticisms, they note that there is a lack of comparison baseline data relating to this hypothesis. It is unclear how often infrasound would be recorded from reputedly non-haunted locations and therefore one is once again faced with the possibility that the hypothesis is based upon the positive-test fallacy. Without data relating to the presence or absence of infrasound at both reputedly haunted and non-haunted locations, one simply cannot properly assess the validity of this hypothesis.

Experimental studies of the effects of directly manipulating the presence or absence of infrasound, as in the current study, offer a powerful alternative approach to test the hypothesis. also criticise the neuropsychological mechanism proposed by Tandy and Lawrence to explain the postulated effects of infrasound. Tandy and Lawrence had proposed that the effects may be produced as a direct consequence of infrasound inducing vibration in the human eyeball due to resonance.

Braithwaite and Townsend present a detailed critique of this argument pointing out, amongst other things, that such vibration would be expected to produce visual distortion across the entire visual field rather than just in peripheral vision and that, furthermore, such vibration would be unlikely to produce complex and sustained hallucinatory experiences. Such visual effects have not been reported in previous investigations of the effects of infrasound.

The current experiment therefore reports an initial attempt to investigate whether, based upon this previous research and speculation, it would be possible to artificially construct a ‘‘haunted’’ room.

The artificial room used was completely empty, white, and circular. Informal pilot testing had suggested that dim illumination and a cool temperature would be the most suitable conditions for this study, insofar as they are the conditions typically associated with reputedly haunted locations.

to record on a floor plan a brief description of any anomalous sensations they experienced, where they were when the experience occurred and the time at which it occurred. A version of which asks respondents whether specific anomalous sensations have occurred, was also employed in this study. Participants were asked to complete the EXIT scale upon leaving the room. It was hypothesised that a greater number of unusual experiences would be recorded on the floor plan and that higher scores on the EXIT scale would be found for those participants exposed to EMF and/or infrasound. Essentially, these two scores were both 	The Haunt Project: P2.81
the EXIT scale would be found for those participants exposed to EMF and/or infrasound. Essentially, these two scores were both measuring the number of experiences reported, using open-ended and closed methodologies, respectively. Additionally, it was hypothesised that those scoring high on the TLS scale might be particularly susceptible to the effects of EMF. Alternatively, if previously reported effects were due mainly to suggestibility, we might find that the actual condition in which participants were run would not have an effect but those scoring higher on the TLS and Australian Sheep– Goat Scales (ASGS) would report more unusual experiences anyway. 2.1. Participants 	The Haunt Project: P2.89

consciously aware of the presence of infrasound during the experiment proper and so pilot tests were run to determine the level to be used. At high intensities, one can actually feel infrasound even though it cannot be heard. Pilot were asked to indicate by means of a button- press at what point they became aware that a stimulus was being played to them on each trial in which the stimulus volume rose from silence to full volume over 22 sec. Participants were informed that no stimulus would be played to them on half the trials. The trials when a stimulus 	The Haunt Project: P2.43
Participants were informed that no stimulus would be played to them on half the trials. The trials when a stimulus was played to them consisted of three trials each at the following frequencies: 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25 Hz. It was thus established that no participant was able to perceive infrasound at a level below 75 dB. No such pilot testing was deemed necessary for the EMF stimulation, as such fields are never consciously perceived. The infrasound waveform used was generated by combining two sine waves at 18.9 and 22.3 Hz (frequencies that correspond to create a more ‘‘complex’’ 	The Haunt Project: P2.61

This was amplified and output through a purpose-built cabinet at a level that was determined from prior experimentation to be below the general ability of human beings to perceive consciously. Measurements indicated that the background noise level in the experimental chamber with all equipment switched off was 50 and 65 dB with the air-conditioning switched on.

At all stages, including the actual output in the space, the accuracy of the signal was monitored by oscilloscope.

The temperature was approximately As can be seen from Fig. 1, most of the EMF output was concentrated in one quadrant of the experimental space (the diagram illustrates the areas where the output is greater than 25 and Participants signed an informed consent form before entering the experimental room and completed three scales upon leaving the room.

Note that previous studies employing the EXIT scale have used a format with three response The change in response format was the reported that the internal consistency across items was sufficient in their version of the EXIT scale to justify the creation of an average score across items.

The Haunt Project: P3.55
had very little effect on internal consistency across items in the current study, lowering Cronbach’s alpha very slightly to .68. Therefore, responses were summed across items to give a total EXIT scale score . The second scale administered was the True–False version of the ASGS. The ASGS is designed to measure belief in, and alleged experience of, the paranormal. It consists of 18 items that all relate specifically to the three core concepts of parapsychology: ESP (extrasensory perception), PK (psychokinesis), and life after death. Example items are ‘‘I believe I have personally exerted PK on at least one occasion’’ and ‘‘I 	The Haunt Project: P3.74
life after death. Example items are ‘‘I believe I have personally exerted PK on at least one occasion’’ and ‘‘I believe in life after death’’. For all items, the response options are ‘‘True’’, ‘‘?’’ (i.e., don’t know) and ‘‘False’’ resulting in a score of 2, 1 or 0 points, respectively. Thus, the scale has a theoretical range from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating higher levels of belief and experience. The ASGS has been widely used and has proven reliability and validity Finally, participants completed the 140-item Personal Philosophy Inventory, but only the 30 items constituting the These items relate 	The Haunt Project: P3.93

According to Persinger, high scorers are particularly susceptible to EMF variability. The items are presented with a True–False response format and the number of ‘‘True’’ responses is tallied.

Procedure Essentially, the experiment involved asking participants to spend 50 min alone wandering around inside the experimental room. During their time in this space they were asked to record any unusual sensations that they felt and to mark the spot on a floor plan at which the sensation occurred, along with the time at which it occurred and a brief description of the experience. Participants were informed in advance that they might be exposed to varying EMFs, infrasound, both or 	The Haunt Project: P4.61
description of the experience. Participants were informed in advance that they might be exposed to varying EMFs, infrasound, both or neither, and that they might experience mildly unusual sensations as a result. Upon completing 50 min in the room, participants completed the three questionnaires and were fully debriefed. 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive statistics and preliminary analyses As participants were recruited from web sites and via email lists, it was possible that the sample recruited might show markedly higher levels of paranormal belief than the general population. However, the overall mean ASGS score for the sample was 12.97 which is similar to 	The Haunt Project: P4.99
belief than the general population. However, the overall mean ASGS score for the sample was 12.97 which is similar to that found in other studies using the ASGS in which participants were not recruited in Thus the sample appeared to be reasonably representative of the general population. Note that in all reported analyses, it is recognised that there will always be a naturally occurring background field; ‘‘EMF present’’ refers to the presence of our artificially produced field over and above this naturally occurring background.

Initially, two-way between-groups Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) were performed separately on the ASGS and TLS scores with infrasound (present vs absent) and EMF (present vs absent) as factors.

Examination of the distribution of scores on the EXIT scale revealed that most participants reported some unusual sensations . Only 6.3% reported none and around 70% reported three or more. However, the distribution was quite positively skewed as was the distribution for the total number of experiences reported on the floor plan. Following Howell , both sets of data were transformed to normalise the distributions using the following transformation: Transformed score ¼ square root (original score)þ square root (original All further analyses 	The Haunt Project: P5.33

Primary analyses Two hierarchical multiple regression analyses were carried out, one on the EXIT scale scores and one for the total number of experiences 	The Haunt Project: P5.44
multiple regression analyses were carried out, one on the EXIT scale scores and one for the total number of experiences reported on the floor plan, using the simultaneous entry (ENTER) method. In each case, the centred TLS and ASGS scores, along with presence/absence of EMF and were entered on the first step as the predictor variables. The hypothesised two-way interaction between EMF and TLS scores was examined in the second step by entering cross-products of these two variables. Results of analyses for transformed EXIT scores and transformed total number of experiences are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Both 	The Haunt Project: P5.55
analyses for transformed EXIT scores and transformed total number of experiences are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Both analyses revealed a similar pattern of results. In each case, on both EXIT scale and floor plan, the only significant predictor of the number of unusual experiences reported was the TLS score. EMF condition, infrasound condition and ASGS scores were not significantly related to either measure and neither, crucially, was the hypothesised interaction between EMF condition and TLS scores.

Also, one referee felt that the format for the ASGS scale might be somewhat confusing for some participants because the ‘‘?’’ response option might just as well indicate uncertainty regarding the meaning of an item (e.g., ‘‘What does psychokinesis mean?’’) as uncertainty regarding the ontological status of that particular paranormal claim (e.g., ‘‘I do not know if psychokinesis exists’’). In line with this referee’s suggestion, additional analyses were carried out with the ‘‘?’’ responses recoded as ‘‘0’’.

participants in this experiment reported experiencing mildly anomalous sensations. To this extent, we can indeed claim some success in building a haunted room. It is possible that the experimental set-up used in this study (a quiet, round, cool, dimly lit, featureless white room) may have constituted a form of mild perceptual deprivation that was sufficient to induce a hallucinatory altered state of consciousness in some participants. Although the set-up differed in significant ways from that used may be of relevance here.

Furthermore, some of the auditory experiences reported by our participants may be a consequence of hyperacusis publication). However, the degree to which these anomalous sensations were reported was unrelated to the experimental conditions employed. Given that all participants were informed in advance that they might experience unusual sensations whilst in the chamber (in line with the ethical requirements of informed consent), the most parsimonious explanation of our findings is in terms of suggestibility. Such an explanation is supported by the fact that TLS scores, known to correlate significantly predicted both the total number of anomalous experiences reported on the floor plan 	The Haunt Project: P6.35
that TLS scores, known to correlate significantly predicted both the total number of anomalous experiences reported on the floor plan and the scores on the EXIT scale. We feel that the data collected cast some light upon the psychology of hauntings. A considerable proportion of the participants reported a number of anomalous sensations in response to a fairly mild suggestion that in our white, round, featureless room they might feel some unusual sensations. Such an explanation is in line with the observations of Houran They asked two volunteers to keep a diary for 30 days of unusual events of the 	The Haunt Project: P6.54
the observations of Houran They asked two volunteers to keep a diary for 30 days of unusual events of the type that are traditionally associated with hauntings and poltergeists in a residence with no prior history of such activity. As expected, the instructions themselves were sufficient for the volunteers to note, with increasing frequency, anomalous or unusual events presumably simply because the volunteers were now primed to notice such phenomena. Our findings also failed to provide any support for the postulated link between the presence of infrasound and the experiencing of anomalous sensations. It is possible that such effects may be 	The Haunt Project: P6.72
link between the presence of infrasound and the experiencing of anomalous sensations. It is possible that such effects may be found under different conditions to those employed in the present study. However, it is worth noting have recently strongly questioned the empirical basis for this alleged association. As previously stated, after examining the evidence put forward in support of the original claim and considering the proposed neurophysiological mechanisms put forward to underlie the effects, Braithwaite and Townsend concluded that the alleged link between anomalous experiences and infrasound had yet to be demonstrated and the current study failed to provide any evidence 	The Haunt Project: P6.91
link between anomalous experiences and infrasound had yet to be demonstrated and the current study failed to provide any evidence in favour of this hypothesis. Our results are consistent with the notion that suggestible participants responded to the general context of our experimental set-up in such a way that they experienced and reported more anomalous sensations than less suggestible participants. It is worth noting that although the number of anomalous sensations reported appeared, on the basis of bivariate correlations, to be related to both (transformed) TLS and ASGS scores, the former appeared to be more strongly related than the latter 	The Haunt Project: P7.04
be related to both (transformed) TLS and ASGS scores, the former appeared to be more strongly related than the latter in this study. The TLS scores correlated significantly with both the EXIT scale scores and the total number of experiences recorded on the floor plan, whereas the ASGS scores correlated significantly with only one of these measures. Furthermore, the only significant predictor to emerge from the multiple regression analyses was the TLS scores. It may be that this pattern of results reflects the general context of this experiment. The fact is that participants in the current study were not led to 	The Haunt Project: P7.11
reflects the general context of this experiment. The fact is that participants in the current study were not led to believe that the experimental room might really be haunted; they were simply told that they might experience some unusual sensations. Given the known power of contextual effects, it is quite probable that had the same participants been told to spend time in a room that was supposedly really haunted, paranormal belief levels would have had a much stronger relationship with the number of experiences reported. Systematic manipulation of such context effects is likely to be a fruitful area for future research. 	The Haunt Project: P7.19

Previous research in other areas strongly suggests that context does influence the way in which respondents fill in questionnaires. As with many psychological experiments, this project raised several issues relating to the inevitable tension between the desirability for ecological validity on the one hand and the need for proper control on the other.

Clearly, if we are attempting to understand possible psychological effects that relate to what people sometimes experience in allegedly haunted houses, it is more ecologically valid to allow people to move around in this way rather than, say, have them sitting still with their eyes closed wearing various magnetic field devices on their heads. On the other hand, one has little control over their chosen movements and therefore one cannot stipulate precisely the actual amount or type of exposure they 	The Haunt Project: P7.33
little control over their chosen movements and therefore one cannot stipulate precisely the actual amount or type of exposure they will receive. In the current study, time spent in each quadrant was not recorded. Future studies should either systematically record such information in order to ensure that all participants receive sufficient exposure to the complex EMF or actually specify the amount of time that participants are to spend in each area of the room. The nature of the field itself can vary infinitely and the participants’ movements through the field will add an extra level of complexity to the field as 	The Haunt Project: P7.41

In this initial study we chose to base the artificial EMFs upon those used by Persinger, but we fully acknowledge that his experimental set-up differs greatly from ours. Amongst the most obvious differences is that his participants do not wander around freely and the weak EMF is applied very close to the scalp. Our decision to administer the ASGS and TLS after the participants had spent time in the experimental room along with the EXIT scale may seem a 	The Haunt Project: P7.48
and TLS after the participants had spent time in the experimental room along with the EXIT scale may seem a little unusual given that predictor variables and outcome measures are not usually assessed in such close temporal proximity. It was felt in this study, however, that to have administered the ASGS and the TLS prior to the participants entering the experimental room may have served to prime them with respect to the type of sensations they might experience and the fact that the study was in some way related to the paranormal. Furthermore, given that both scales measure relatively stable trait-like 	The Haunt Project: P7.55
that the study was in some way related to the paranormal. Furthermore, given that both scales measure relatively stable trait-like dispositions; the experimental manipulations would be unlikely to have any major impact upon how participants completed these scales. The decision as to whether to administer scales at the beginning or the end of experiments which involve participants being exposed to ostensibly paranormal experiences (OPEs) is always a difficult one. If participants complete the scales prior to being exposed to the OPE, their responses on the scale might influence their reports of how they interpreted the OPE. For example, if one had 	The Haunt Project: P7.63
their responses on the scale might influence their reports of how they interpreted the OPE. For example, if one had just declared one’s complete disbelief in ESP, one may then be less inclined to accept as real a subsequent demonstration of what appeared to be that very ability (albeit that the demonstration may have been based upon trickery). On the other hand, if one had just witnessed such a demonstration prior to completing the scales at the end of the experiment, the demonstration itself may have an effect upon one’s responses by making one feel more inclined to accept the possibility 	The Haunt Project: P7.7
the demonstration itself may have an effect upon one’s responses by making one feel more inclined to accept the possibility that ESP might really exist. Some investigators have opted for having half the participants complete paranormal belief scales before the experiment and the other half afterwards, but clearly there is no ideal solution to this dilemma. Furthermore, it should be noted that given the inevitably quasi-experimental nature of any investigation of the relationship between trait-like dispositions (such as paranormal belief levels) and other variables, no strong conclusions can be drawn regarding the direction of causality involved regardless of when the 	The Haunt Project: P7.78

Participants cannot be randomly allocated to belief levels and conclusions relating to such traits must always be tentatively drawn on the basis of the pattern of correlations revealed as opposed to the drawing of strong conclusions regarding the direction of causality. Although the results reported do not support the idea that complex EMFs play a role in inducing anomalous experiences, the limitations of the current experimental set-up must be acknowledged.

anomalous experiences, the limitations of the current experimental set-up must be acknowledged. As stated, the decision to allow participants to wander around freely within the experimental space in the interests of ecological validity meant that the amount of time that they spent in those areas of the room affected by the complex EMF was not under experimental control. However, there was no evidence that more unusual sensations were reported when participants were in the quadrant most affected by EMF compared to the others. It should also be noted that practical limitations precluded the use of double-blind methodology in this study. Although 	The Haunt Project: P7.92

Although participants were unaware of the condition to which they had been allocated, the experimenters were aware of the condition. Had we found results supporting the EMF hypothesis, this might have raised questions regarding the validity of our findings, but as all experimenters were anticipating positive results, any unintended bias would presumably have favoured the EMF hypothesis. In future studies, however, it would be preferable to employ double-blind methodology. A fruitful line for future research would be to focus more directly 	The Haunt Project: P8
it would be preferable to employ double-blind methodology. A fruitful line for future research would be to focus more directly upon the possible neuropsychological bases for susceptibility to paranormal belief and the reporting of OPEs. Possible directions would be further investigations of the presumed association between paranormal belief and dopamine, and thus the increased likelihood of perceiving salient In connection with the findings relating to temporal lobe signs, early suggestions of hippocampal hypersensitivity also merit further exploration .

Similarly, no one has ever suggested that postulated EMF and infrasound effects, either alone or in combination, would provide a comprehensive explanation for all alleged hauntings, even if cases based on sincere misinterpretation of naturally occurring phenomena and cases of deliberate hoax are excluded (for examples of such cases, see Baker and Nickell, 1992; Christopher, 1971; Morris, 1977–1978; Randi, 1984– Taking the current findings in the context of previous relevant research, it is clear that factors such as suggestibility, temporal lobe 	The Haunt Project: P8.42

The case for infrasound inducing haunt-type experiences now appears to be extremely powerful critique and the current negative findings. Wefeel, however, that the possibility of EMF-related effects is worthy for further investigation. Although, to date, no independent investigator has replicated the results reported by Persinger using transcerebral complex magnetic fields, evidence from is at least suggestive of the possibility that the 	The Haunt Project: P8.56

In contrast to infrasound, where the waveform used in the current experiment might reasonably have been expected to induce anomalous experiences if the infrasound hypothesis is correct, EMFs vary with respect to many more parameters.

In future work, we intend to base the EMF waveforms upon those directly recorded from reputedly haunted locations 2004; Braithwaite et al., 2004; Braithwaite and Townsend, by ‘‘replaying’’ data collected from such a site. We readily acknowledge that ours was a very conservative test of the hypothesis that complex EMFs may induce anomalous experiences in susceptible individuals and feel that further tests of the hypothesis are justified.
